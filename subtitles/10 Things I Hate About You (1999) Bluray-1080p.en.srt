1
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,807
Hey!

2
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:04,316
I'll be right with you.

3
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:19,414
So, Cameron. Here you go.

4
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:23,168
Nine schools in 10 years.
My, my. Army brat?

5
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,837
-Yeah. My dad is...
-That's enough.

6
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:30,425
I'm sure you won't find Padua
any different than your old schools.

7
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,179
Same little ass-wipe shit-for-brains
everywhere.

8
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:41,186
Excuse me? Did you just say...
Am I in the right office?

9
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:44,022
Not any more, you're not. I've got
deviants to see and a novel to finish.

10
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:46,024
Now, scoot. Scoot!

11
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:47,818
Okay.

12
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,946
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

13
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:56,535
Patrick Verona.

14
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:59,204
I see we're making
our visits a weekly ritual.

15
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:02,874
Only so we can have these moments
together. Should I hit the lights?

16
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,544
Oh, very clever, kangaroo boy.

17
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:08,130
Says here you exposed yourself
in the cafeteria?

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,717
I was joking with the lunch lady.
It was a bratwurst.

19
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,051
Bratwurst?

20
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,346
Aren't we the optimist?

21
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:22,060
Next time, keep it in your pouch, okay?

22
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:24,229
Scoot!

23
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,746
Hello! Michael Eckman.
I'm supposed to show you around.

24
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,998
Oh, hi. Thank God. You know...

25
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:45,917
Normally they send down
one of those audio visual geeks.

26
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:47,753
No, I do. I know what you mean.

27
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,421
Hey, Michael,
where should I put those slides?

28
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:53,592
Michael? So... Cameron.

29
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,929
Here's the breakdown. Over there,
we've got your basic beautiful people.

30
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:01,433
Now listen. Unless they talk
to you first, don't bother.

31
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:04,519
-Wait. Is that your rule or theirs?
-Watch. Hey, there.

32
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:06,605
-Eat me.
-You see that?

33
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,609
To the left, we have the coffee kids.

34
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:13,195
-That was Costa Rican, butthead!
-Very edgy.

35
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,197
Don't make any sudden movements
around them.

36
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:17,783
These delusionals
are your white Rastas.

37
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,452
They're big Marley fans.
They think they're black.

38
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:22,454
-Semi-political, but mostly...
-Smoke a lot of weed?

39
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,707
-Yeah. These guys...
-Wait, wait. Let me guess. Cowboys?

40
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:29,419
Yeah, but the closest they've come
to a cow is McDonald's.

41
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,964
McDonald's.

42
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,967
These are your future MBAs.
We're all Ivy League accepted.

43
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:37,969
Yuppie greed is back, my friend.

44
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:40,972
-Hey, guys, how you doin'?
-Close it, Bogey!

45
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:45,060
-Yesterday, I was their god.
-What happened?

46
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:48,980
Bogey Lowenstein
started a rumor that I...

47
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:52,150
That I buy my Izods at an outlet mall.

48
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:55,153
-So they kicked you out?
-Hostile takeover. But don't worry.

49
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:58,281
-He'll pay. Now, over here...
-Oh, my God.

50
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,668
-What group is she in?
-The "don't even think about it" group.

51
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:11,253
That's Bianca Stratford.
She's a sophomore.

52
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:13,672
I burn, I pine, I perish.

53
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:17,342
Of course you do.
You know, she's beautiful and deep.

54
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:18,802
I'm sure.

55
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:22,013
Yeah, but see, there's a difference
between like and love.

56
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,684
Because I like my Skechers,
but I love my Prada backpack.

57
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,186
But I love my Skechers.

58
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,439
That's because you don't have
a Prada backpack.

59
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:36,027
Listen, forget her.
Incredibly uptight father.

60
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:37,195
And it's a widely known fact that

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,031
the Stratford sisters
aren't allowed to date.

62
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,700
Yeah.

63
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:43,785
Whatever.

64
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,629
Okay, then. What did everyone
think of The Sun Also Rises?

65
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:58,383
I loved it. He's so romantic.

66
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,635
Romantic? Hemingway?

67
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,638
He was an abusive, alcoholic
misogynist who squandered half his life

68
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:06,224
hanging around Picasso
trying to nail his leftovers.

69
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:09,895
As opposed to a bitter,
self-righteous hag who has no friends?

70
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,899
Pipe down, Chachi.

71
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:17,319
I guess in this society,
being male and an asshole

72
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,237
makes you worthy of our time.

73
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:21,907
What about Sylvia Plath,

74
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:24,743
or Charlotte Brontë
or Simone de Beauvoir?

75
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,079
What'd I miss?

76
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:31,416
The oppressive patriarchal values
that dictate our education.

77
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,584
Good.

78
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:35,504
-Hey, hey!
-Mr Morgan.

79
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,839
Is there any chance we could get Kat
to take her Midol

80
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,883
before she comes to class?

81
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,928
Someday you're gonna get
bitch-slapped,

82
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,722
and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it.

83
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,100
And, Kat, I want to thank you
for your point of view.

84
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:51,686
I know how difficult it must be for you
to overcome all those years

85
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,523
of upper-middle class
suburban oppression.

86
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,107
Must be tough.

87
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:00,278
But the next time you storm the P.T.A.,
crusading for better lunch meat,

88
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:02,280
or whatever it is
you white girls complain about,

89
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:05,116
ask them why they can't buy a book
written by a black man!

90
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:08,828
-That's right, mon!
-Don't even get me started on you two.

91
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:12,582
Anything else?

92
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,252
Yeah, go to the office.
You're pissing me off.

93
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,504
-What? Mr Morgan...
-Later!

94
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,971
Undulating with desire,

95
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:29,808
Adrienne removes her red...

96
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,654
Crimson cape

97
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,032
at the sight of Reginald's stiff and...

98
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,664
Judith!

99
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,294
What's another word for "engorged"?

100
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,713
I'll look it up.

101
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,964
Okay.

102
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:06,678
-Swollen. Turgid.
-Tumescent?

103
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,972
Perfect.

104
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:13,518
So, I hear you were terrorizing
Mr Morgan's class again.

105
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,398
Expressing my opinion
is not a terrorist action.

106
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:21,484
The way you expressed your opinion
to Bobby Ridgeway?

107
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,613
By the way, his testicle
retrieval operation went quite well,

108
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,448
in case you're interested.

109
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:29,826
I still maintain
that he kicked himself in the balls.

110
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,745
The point is, Kat...

111
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,415
Cat.

112
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,757
People perceive you as somewhat...

113
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,008
Tempestuous?

114
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,053
"Heinous bitch" is
the term used most often.

115
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,849
You might want to work on that.

116
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:55,894
Thank you.

117
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:59,522
As always, thank you
for your excellent guidance.

118
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,734
I'll let you get back
to Reginald's quivering member.

119
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,739
"Quivering member." I like that.

120
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,076
Virgin alert. Your favorite.

121
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,501
Lookin' good, ladies.

122
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:22,253
Oh, she's out of reach, even for you.

123
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:26,091
-No one's out of reach for me.
-You wanna put money on that?

124
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,134
Money, I've got.

125
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:30,553
This I'm gonna do for fun.

126
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,059
-Who's that guy?
-That's Joey Donner.

127
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,728
He's a jerk off, and a model.

128
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:40,355
-He's a model?
- A model.

129
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,692
Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored
to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

130
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,443
-Really?
-Really.

131
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,910
Man, look at her. Is she always so...

132
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,371
-Vapid?
-How can you say that? She's totally...

133
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,248
-Conceited.
-What are you talking about?

134
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,125
There's more to her than you think.

135
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:04,546
Look at the way she smiles,
and look at her eyes, man.

136
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,967
She's totally pure.
You're missing what's there.

137
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,636
No, no, Cameron, no. What's there

138
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:16,057
is a snotty little princess wearing
a strategically planned sun dress

139
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:19,561
to make guys like us realize
that we can never touch her

140
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:22,480
and guys like Joey realize
that they want to.

141
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:26,192
She, my friend, is what we will spend
the rest of our lives not having.

142
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,278
Put her in your spank bank, move on.

143
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,197
-Move on.
-No, no. You're wrong about her.

144
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:33,616
I mean, you know,
not about the spanking part,

145
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,076
but the rest, you're wrong.

146
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,705
All right... I'm wrong?
You wanna take a shot, be my guest.

147
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,623
She's actually looking
for a French tutor.

148
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,792
Are you serious? That's perfect!

149
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,878
Do you speak French?

150
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,172
Well, no, but I will.

151
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:53,970
Hey. Your little Rambo look is out, Kat.

152
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,974
-Didn't you read last month's Cosmo?
-Run along.

153
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,522
I know you can be overwhelmed,
and you can be underwhelmed,

154
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,816
but can you ever just be "whelmed"?

155
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,445
-I think you can in Europe.
-Hi, ladies.

156
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,323
Would you sweet young things
like a ride?

157
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,914
Careful on the leather.

158
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:27,337
That's a charming new development.

159
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,047
It's disgusting.

160
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,261
Remove head from sphincter,
then drive!

161
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,685
-You okay?
-Yeah.

162
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,396
Just a minor encounter with the shrew.

163
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:49,025
-That's your girlfriend's sister.
-That's Bianca's sister?

164
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,403
The mewling, rampallian, wretch herself.

165
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,406
-Stay cool, bro.
-Yeah, see you later.

166
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:57,867
Look out!

167
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,418
My balls! Oh, boy.

168
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:26,938
Yeah!

169
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:17,196
Hello, Katarina.
Make anyone cry today?

170
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,158
Sadly, no. But it's only 4:30.

171
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,120
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hello, precious.

172
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,623
-And where have you been?
-Nowhere.

173
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,500
Hey, what's this?
It says Sarah Lawrence.

174
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,675
I got in!

175
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:39,969
Honey, that's great,

176
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:42,096
but isn't Sarah Lawrence
on the other side of the country?

177
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:44,515
Thus the basis of its appeal.

178
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:46,809
I thought we decided you were
going to stay here and go to school.

179
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,187
"U-Dub," like me. Be a Husky.

180
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:52,982
No, you decided.

181
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:56,486
Oh, okay, so what, you just pick up
and leave, is that it?

182
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,029
Let's hope so.

183
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,573
Ask Bianca who drove her home.

184
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,784
Kat, don't change the...
Drove? Who drove you home?

185
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,370
Now, don't get upset, Daddy,
but there's this boy...

186
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:08,206
-Who's a flaming imbecile.
-And I think he might ask me...

187
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,166
Please. I think I know
what he's going to ask you.

188
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,086
And I think I know the answer. No.
It's always no.

189
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,879
What are the two house rules?

190
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:17,382
Number one,
no dating till you graduate.

191
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:20,218
Number two,
no dating till you graduate.

192
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:23,221
-That's it.
-Daddy, that's so unfair.

193
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:26,307
All right, you want to know
what's unfair? This is for you, too.

194
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:29,686
This morning I delivered a set of twins
to a 15 year old girl.

195
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,312
Do you know what she said to me?

196
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,772
I'm a crack whore who should have

197
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:35,483
made my skeezy boyfriend
wear a condom?

198
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,737
Close, but no.

199
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:43,074
She said,
"I should have listened to my father."

200
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:45,702
-She did not.
-Well, that's what she would have said

201
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,829
if she wasn't so doped up.

202
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,165
Can we focus on me
for a second, please?

203
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,376
I am the only girl in school
who's not dating.

204
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,961
Oh, no, you're not.
Your sister doesn't date.

205
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,337
And I don't intend to.

206
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,047
And why is that again?

207
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:01,134
Have you seen the unwashed
miscreants that go to that school?

208
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,511
Where did you come from?
Planet Loser?

209
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:06,597
As opposed to
Planet Look At Me, Look At Me.

210
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:09,058
Okay, here's how we solve this one.

211
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:12,979
Old rule out. New rule, Bianca can date

212
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,025
when she does.

213
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,195
But she's a mutant!
What if she never dates?

214
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,656
Then you'll never date. Oh, I like that.

215
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:26,117
And I'll get to sleep at night.

216
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,368
The deep slumber of a father

217
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,954
whose daughters aren't out
being impregnated.

218
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:33,958
-We'll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.
-Fine.

219
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,960
-Wait! Daddy!
-Gotta go.

220
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,922
Can't you just find
some blind, deaf retard

221
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,175
to take you to the movies
so I can have one date?

222
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,177
I'm sorry. Looks like
you'll just have to miss out

223
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:47,221
on the witty repartee
of Joey "Eat Me" Donner.

224
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:51,017
You suck.

225
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,823
Hi. Can we make this quick?

226
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:08,367
Roxanne Corinne and Andrew Jarrett
are having an incredibly horrendous

227
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,870
public break-up on the quad, again.

228
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,624
Oh, yeah, okay. I thought that we'd

229
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,044
start with pronunciation,
if that's all right with you.

230
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,547
Not the hacking and gagging
and spitting part, please.

231
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,217
Well, there is an alternative.

232
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:27,303
-There is?
-Yeah, French food.

233
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,264
We could eat some together

234
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,184
Saturday night?

235
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,730
You're asking me out?

236
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,900
That's so cute.
What's your name again?

237
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,153
Cameron. Listen, I know
that your dad doesn't let you date,

238
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,489
but I thought
that if it was for French class...

239
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,534
-Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...
-Cameron.

240
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:53,579
My dad just came up with a new rule.
I can date when my sister does.

241
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,249
You're kidding.
Let me ask you, do you like sailing?

242
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,959
'Cause I read about this place
that rents boats...

243
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,877
A beaucoup problemo, Calvin.

244
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:04,632
In case you haven't heard, my sister's
a particularly hideous breed of loser.

245
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,886
Yeah. Yeah, I noticed
she's a little antisocial.

246
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:11,931
-Why is that?
-Unsolved mystery.

247
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,517
She used to be really popular,
and then it was like

248
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,727
she got sick of it or something.

249
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:18,062
Theories abound as to why,

250
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:21,149
but I'm pretty sure she's just
incapable of human interaction.

251
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,151
Plus, she's a bitch.

252
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,029
Well, yeah, but I'm sure,
you know, that there are

253
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:31,075
lots of guys who wouldn't mind
going out with a difficult woman.

254
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:35,288
I mean, you know, people jump
out of airplanes and ski off cliffs.

255
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:38,583
It'd be like "Extreme Dating."

256
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,712
You think you could find
someone that extreme?

257
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,589
Yeah, sure, why not?

258
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:47,967
-And you'd do that for me?
-Hell, yes!

259
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:51,304
I mean, you know, I could look into it.

260
00:17:57,186 --> 00:18:01,022
Now, I have gathered a group of guys,
couldn't be more perfect.

261
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,648
Padua's finest.

262
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,946
Hi. How you doin'?

263
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:13,951
Would any of you be interested
in dating Katarina Stratford?

264
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,791
I've never been that ripped.

265
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:24,003
Maybe if we were
the last two people alive,

266
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:25,922
and there were no sheep.

267
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,131
Are there sheep?

268
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,433
Did I or did I not tell you
it was pointless?

269
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,518
No one will go out with her.

270
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,983
Hey, hey, what about him?

271
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,444
Him? No, don't...
Don't look at him, okay?

272
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:52,657
He's a criminal.
I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.

273
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:56,661
-He just did a year in San Quentin.
-Well, at least he's horny.

274
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,413
I'm serious, man. He's whacked.

275
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:04,001
He sold his own liver on the
black market for a new set of speakers.

276
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,760
He's our guy.

277
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:32,363
Hi. How you doin'?

278
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:33,572
Listen, I...

279
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,869
Okay. Later, then.

280
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,546
How do we get him to date Kat?

281
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,090
I don't know.

282
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,218
I mean, we could pay him,

283
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,930
but we don't have any money.

284
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,558
Yeah, well, what we need is a backer.

285
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:04,395
-What's that?
-Someone with money who's stupid.

286
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,067
Oh, yeah.

287
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,412
Is that a peach Fruit Roll-Up?
Because you don't see many...

288
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:24,332
Oh, okay. Yeah. All right.

289
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,709
-Are you lost?
-No.

290
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,753
Actually, I just came by to chat.

291
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,298
-We don't chat.
-Well, actually, I thought

292
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:35,509
that I'd run an idea by you,
just to see if you're interested.

293
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:38,012
-I'm not.
-Well, hear me out.

294
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:41,098
Now, you want Bianca, right?

295
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:44,894
But she can't go out with you
because her sister

296
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,814
is this insane head case, and no one
will go out with her, right?

297
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,733
Does this conversation
have a purpose?

298
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,818
What I think you need to do,

299
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,946
is you need to hire a guy
who'll go out with her.

300
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,574
Someone who doesn't scare so easily.

301
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:02,078
That guy?

302
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,832
-I heard he ate a live duck once.
-Everything but the beak and feet.

303
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,627
Clearly, he's a solid investment.

304
00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:12,797
-What's in it for you?
-Hey.

305
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:16,842
I'm walking down the hall and
I say hello to you, you say hello to me.

306
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,970
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You're cool by association.

307
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,432
I'll think about it.

308
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:29,021
-We're done now.
-Yeah.

309
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,444
What are you doing
getting him involved?

310
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,779
Relax, now. Relax.

311
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,781
We let him pretend
he's calling the shots.

312
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,827
While he's busy setting things up,
you have time with Bianca.

313
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,039
That is a good idea. All right.

314
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:52,169
I have a dick on my face, don't I?

315
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,134
Now, remember, guys,

316
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:01,637
grip it and rip it.

317
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,445
Hey. How you doin'?

318
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,076
I had some great duck last night.

319
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:27,872
Do I know you?

320
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,541
You see that girl?

321
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,004
-Yeah.
-That's Kat Stratford.

322
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,339
I want you to go out with her.

323
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,633
Yeah, sure, Sparky.

324
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:45,514
Look, I can't take out her sister
until Kat starts dating.

325
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,350
You see, their dad's whacked out.
He's got this rule where the girls...

326
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,770
That's a touching story. It really is.
Not my problem.

327
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:54,356
Would you be willing
to make it your problem

328
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,901
if I provide generous compensation?

329
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,530
You're gonna pay me
to take out some chick?

330
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,119
-How much?
-Twenty bucks.

331
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:16,754
Fine, 30.

332
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,591
Well, let's think about this.

333
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:24,595
We go to the movies, that's 1 5 bucks.

334
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,059
We get popcorn, that's 53.

335
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:33,437
And she'll want Raisinets, right?

336
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:37,316
So, we're looking at 75 bucks.

337
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:41,362
This isn't a negotiation.
Take it or leave it, Trailer Park.

338
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:44,532
Fifty bucks and we got a deal, Fabio.

339
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,747
Great practice, everybody.

340
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,833
-Good hustle, Stratford.
-Thanks, Mr Chapin.

341
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:06,887
Hey there, girlie. How you doin'?

342
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:09,557
Sweating like a pig, actually.
And yourself?

343
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:12,059
Now, there's a way to get
a guy's attention, huh?

344
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,270
My mission in life.

345
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:17,064
But obviously, I struck your fancy,
so, you see, it worked.

346
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:18,816
The world makes sense again.

347
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:23,946
-Pick you up on Friday, then.
-Oh, right. Friday.

348
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:28,576
Well, the night I take you places
you've never been before.

349
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,869
Like where?
The 7-Eleven on Broadway?

350
00:24:30,954 --> 00:24:33,622
Do you even know
my name, screw boy?

351
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,874
I know a lot more than you think.

352
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,918
Doubtful. Very doubtful.

353
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:46,302
We are screwed.

354
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,345
Hey, I don't want to hear
that defeatist attitude.

355
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,473
-I want to hear you upbeat.
-We're screwed!

356
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,601
-There you go.
-Hey, Coach Chapin!

357
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,608
Run, Bogey!

358
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:09,950
Have you ever considered a new look?

359
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:12,369
I mean, seriously. You could
have some definite potential

360
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:14,538
buried under all this hostility.

361
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:17,333
I'm not hostile. I'm annoyed.

362
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,501
Why don't you try being nice?

363
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,420
People wouldn't know what to think.

364
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,672
You forget,
I don't care what people think.

365
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:25,132
Yes, you do.

366
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,009
No, I don't.

367
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:31,180
You don't always have to be
who they want you to be, you know.

368
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:35,267
I happen to like being adored,
thank you.

369
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,728
Where'd you get the pearls?

370
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,313
They're Mom's.

371
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:42,524
And you've been what,
hiding them for three years?

372
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:44,818
No. Daddy found them
in a drawer last week.

373
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:46,862
So you're just gonna start
wearing them now?

374
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:49,907
It's not like she's coming back
to claim them!

375
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:54,703
Besides, they look good on me.

376
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:57,790
Trust me. They don't.

377
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,756
Nice ride. Vintage fenders.

378
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:08,217
Are you following me?

379
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,512
I was in the Laundromat.
I saw your car. I came over to say hi.

380
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:12,680
Hi.

381
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:17,810
-Not a big talker, huh?
-Depends on the topic.

382
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:20,813
My fenders don't really whip me
into a verbal frenzy.

383
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:24,608
-You're not afraid of me, are you?
-Why would I be afraid of you?

384
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:27,194
-Well, most people are.
-Well, I'm not.

385
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,320
Well, maybe you're not afraid of me,

386
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:31,240
but I'm sure
you've thought about me naked.

387
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,617
Am I that transparent?

388
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,578
I want you, I need you.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

389
00:26:46,214 --> 00:26:48,340
What is it, asshole day?

390
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,218
-Do you mind?
-Not at all.

391
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,522
You bitch!

392
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,777
Whoops.

393
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,612
"Whoops"?

394
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:14,283
My insurance does not cover PMS!

395
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:19,079
Well, then tell them I had a seizure.

396
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:20,247
Is this about Sarah Lawrence?

397
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:22,499
Are you punishing me because
I want you to stay close to home?

398
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,294
Aren't you punishing me
because Mom left?

399
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,296
You think you could
leave her out of this?

400
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,465
Fine.
Then stop making my decisions for me.

401
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,467
I'm your father. That's my right.

402
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,719
So what I want doesn't matter.

403
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,471
You're 1 8.
You don't know what you want.

404
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:37,806
And you won't know
what you want till you're 45,

405
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,225
and even if you get it,
you'll be too old to use it.

406
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,144
I want to go to an East Coast school!

407
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,812
I want you to trust me
to make my own choices,

408
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,689
and I want you to stop trying
to control my life

409
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:48,358
just because you can't control yours!

410
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,569
Yeah? Well, you know what I want?

411
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,990
We'll continue this later.

412
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,450
Can't wait.

413
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:01,121
Did you just maim Joey's car?

414
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,207
Yeah. Looks like you're gonna
have to take the bus.

415
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,417
Has the fact
that you're completely psycho

416
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:07,795
managed to escape your attention?

417
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:10,214
Daddy!

418
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,389
-When I shell out 50, I expect results.
-Yeah, I'm on it.

419
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:23,018
Watching that bitch violate my car
doesn't count as a date.

420
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,063
Now, if you don't get any,
I don't get any.

421
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:28,482
So get some.

422
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,652
I just upped my price.

423
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:34,863
-What?
-Hundred bucks a date.

424
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:38,784
-In advance.
-Forget it.

425
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:41,286
Well, forget her sister, then.

426
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:49,419
You better hope you're as smooth
as you think you are, Verona.

427
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,558
-Go.
-No, you go.

428
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,184
I went before.

429
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:15,737
We know what you're trying to do
with Kat Stratford.

430
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:18,907
Is that right?
What do you plan to do about it?

431
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:21,243
-Help you out.
-Why's that?

432
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,413
The situation is,

433
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:28,458
my man Cameron here
has a Major Jones for Bianca Stratford.

434
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:31,879
What is it with this chick?
She have beer-flavored nipples?

435
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:35,549
-Hey!
-I... I think I speak correctly

436
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:38,260
when I say that Cameron's love is pure,

437
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,178
purer than, say, Joey Donner's.

438
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:42,514
I'm in this for the cash.
Donner can plow whoever he wants.

439
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,933
Okay, there will be no plowing.

440
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,603
Patrick... Pat...

441
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,314
Let me explain something to you here.

442
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,276
We set this whole thing up
so Cameron can get the girl. Cameron.

443
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,153
Joey's just a pawn.

444
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:01,450
So, you two are gonna
help me tame the wild beast.

445
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:02,659
Absolutely.

446
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:05,746
We'll do some research,
we'll find out what she likes.

447
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,497
We're your guys.

448
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:11,793
And he means that in
a strictly non-prison movie type of way.

449
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:14,880
Let's start here.

450
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:18,634
Now, Friday night,
Bogey Lowenstein is having a party.

451
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:20,844
It's the perfect opportunity.

452
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:24,598
-Perfect opportunity for what?
-For you to take out Kat.

453
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:28,310
I'll think about it.

454
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:32,314
And for a little payback.

455
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,858
This is gonna be some party.

456
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:45,994
Let's do this.

457
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,476
Now, this is really important, okay?

458
00:31:09,811 --> 00:31:12,104
Which one do you like better?

459
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:19,861
I think I like the white shirt better.

460
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,447
-Yeah, it's... It's more...
-Pensive?

461
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:26,326
Damn. I was going for thoughtful.

462
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,036
So, are you going to
Bogey Lowenbrau's thing

463
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,579
on Friday night?

464
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:31,331
Yeah, I might.

465
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:35,502
Good, 'cause you know, I'm not
gonna bother if you won't be there.

466
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:40,090
See you there.

467
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:41,883
-Okay.
-All right.

468
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:01,570
So, have you heard
about Bogey Lowenstein's party?

469
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:05,615
Yes, and I really, really,
really want to go.

470
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:09,327
But you know I can't.
Not unless my sister does.

471
00:32:09,412 --> 00:32:11,830
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on that, but so far,

472
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,458
you know, she's not going for my guy.

473
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:18,003
-She's not a...
-K.D. Lang fan? No.

474
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:20,630
I found a picture of Jared Leto
in her drawer once,

475
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:23,967
so I'm pretty sure she's not
harboring same-sex tendencies.

476
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:28,055
Okay, so that's the kind of guys
she likes... Like, pretty guys.

477
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:29,765
I don't know. All I've ever heard her say

478
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:33,060
is that she'd die
before dating a guy that smokes.

479
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:35,312
Okay, all right, no smoking. What else?

480
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,314
You're asking me
to investigate the inner workings

481
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:39,274
of my sister's twisted mind?

482
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,318
I don't think so.

483
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,111
Well, nothing else has worked.

484
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:45,947
We need to go
behind enemy lines here.

485
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:52,329
Okay, here we go.

486
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,749
Class schedule, reading list,

487
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,377
date book, concert tickets,
concert tickets.

488
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,177
Black panties!

489
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:09,221
What does that tell us?

490
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:11,807
She wants to have sex someday,
that's what.

491
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:14,226
You... She could just like the color.

492
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,354
You don't buy black lingerie
unless you want someone to see it.

493
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:23,777
So... Can I see your room?

494
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,363
No.

495
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:32,327
A girl's room is very personal.

496
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:34,871
Oh, okay.

497
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,844
-Nice bike.
-Yeah, you think so?

498
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:06,153
Wow. Is this what a bar looks like?

499
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:10,866
Don't touch anything.
You may get hepatitis.

500
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:23,795
So, what have you got for me?

501
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,465
A little insight
into a very complicated girl.

502
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:31,136
Excuse me.
Just one question before we start.

503
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:34,222
Should you be drinking alcohol
when you don't have a liver?

504
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,308
-What?
-Nothing. Nothing.

505
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,063
All right, first thing. Kat hates smokers.

506
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:48,737
So, you're telling me I'm a non-smoker.

507
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:53,200
-Yes. Well, just for now.
-And here's another problem.

508
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:56,953
Bianca said that Kat likes pretty guys.

509
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,588
Are you telling me I'm not a pretty guy?

510
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,923
He's very pretty!

511
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:11,760
-This is a gorgeous guy.
-I just wasn't sure. I didn't know.

512
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,890
All right. Yeah, okay. Here's this.

513
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,268
"Likes.

514
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:24,731
"Thai food, feminist prose
and angry girl music

515
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:27,150
"of the indie rock persuasion."

516
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:29,945
Here's a list of CDs
she has in her room.

517
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:34,616
So, I'm supposed to buy her
some noodles and a book

518
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,494
and sit around listening to chicks
who can't play their instruments, right?

519
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:39,996
Have you ever been to Club Skunk?

520
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:42,791
Her favorite band's
playing there tomorrow night.

521
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,126
I can't be seen at Club Skunk, all right?

522
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:46,962
But she'll be there. She's got tickets.

523
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:49,381
Assail your ears for one night.

524
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:55,053
She has a pair of black underwear.

525
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:57,305
If that helps.

526
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:59,641
Couldn't hurt, right?

527
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:19,387
Verona! What are you doing here?

528
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:21,806
I need aqua

529
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:29,606
Two waters.

530
00:37:37,365 --> 00:37:40,241
If you're planning on asking me out,
you might as well just get it over with.

531
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:43,745
Do you mind?
You're kind of ruining this for me.

532
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,206
You're not surrounded by
your usual cloud of smoke.

533
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,250
I know. I quit.
Apparently they're bad for you.

534
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,710
You think?

535
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:55,757
You know, these guys
are no Bikini Kill or the Raincoats.

536
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:57,842
But they're not bad.

537
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,849
-You know who the Raincoats are?
-Why, don't you?

538
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,688
I was watching you out there before.
I've never seen you look so sexy.

539
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:24,494
-Come to Bogey's party with me.
-You never give up, do you?

540
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:27,914
Was that a yes?

541
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:31,292
-No.
-Well, then, was that a no?

542
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:34,462
-No.
-I'll see you at 9:30 then!

543
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:47,725
Should have used the window.

544
00:38:48,477 --> 00:38:50,145
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi.

545
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:53,440
Where are we going?

546
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:56,985
Well, if you must know,
a small study group of friends.

547
00:38:57,153 --> 00:38:59,320
Otherwise known as an orgy?

548
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,656
Mr Stratford, it's just a party.

549
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,783
And hell is just a sauna.

550
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,162
Do you know anything about a party?

551
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:11,082
-People expect me to be there.
-Kat's not going, you're not going.

552
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,501
Why can't you be normal?

553
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:16,337
-Define "normal."
-Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal.

554
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:19,007
-What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
-Bogey's party is just a lame excuse

555
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,800
for all the idiots at our school
to drink beer

556
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,260
and rub up against each other

557
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:24,471
in hopes of distracting themselves
from the pathetic emptiness

558
00:39:24,555 --> 00:39:25,638
of their meaningless...

559
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:28,516
-Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.
-Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.

560
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,227
Can you, for just one night,

561
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:34,772
forget that you're completely wretched
and be my sister?

562
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:39,235
Please?

563
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,991
Come on, Kat. Please do this for me.

564
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:49,245
Fine. I'll make an appearance.

565
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,087
-It's starting.
-It's just a party, Daddy.

566
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,343
I want you to wear the belly.

567
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,053
Daddy, no.

568
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,180
Not all night.

569
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,141
Just around the living room for a minute
so you can understand

570
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:12,852
the full weight of your decisions.

571
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:17,065
-I am perfectly aware...
-Listen to me.

572
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:19,484
Every time you even think
about kissing a boy,

573
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,278
I want you to picture wearing this
under your halter top.

574
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:24,447
You are so completely unbalanced.

575
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:27,408
-We're going now.
-All right, wait a minute.

576
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:29,661
No drinking, no drugs, no kissing,

577
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:33,957
no tattoos, no piercings,
no ritual animal slaughters of any kind.

578
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,251
Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas.

579
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:37,961
Daddy!

580
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:41,589
-What are you doing here?
-9:30, right?

581
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:45,093
-Oh, I'm early.
-Whatever. I'm driving.

582
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,263
Who knocked up your sister?

583
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,810
So then, Bianca says that I was right,

584
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:56,563
that she didn't wear the Kenneth Coles
with that dress

585
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:00,275
because she thought that it was
mixing genres, right?

586
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:04,237
And the fact that I noticed,
and this is a direct quote, listen,

587
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:06,614
"Really meant something."

588
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,950
You told me that part already.

589
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,910
I've been thinking about her
all the time.

590
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:15,540
Stop being so self-involved
for one minute. How do I look?

591
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:19,043
You look like my Great Uncle Milton.

592
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:21,504
-You think I should lose the tie?
-Yeah.

593
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:24,173
Maybe you're right. I'm just so nervous.

594
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:27,135
And I'm also very excited.
I'm nervous, I'm excited.

595
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:29,095
It's all very mixed up.
I don't know what to do!

596
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:31,889
All right, just calm down, all right?

597
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:35,226
The last party I went to
was at Chuck E. Cheese.

598
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:39,188
You want to talk about some fun.
That's a good time.

599
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:05,840
Now, remember, guys.
Don't touch anything.

600
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:10,845
What did I tell you?

601
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:15,224
Must be Nigel with the Brie.

602
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:45,004
You know, I'm...
I'm thinking of getting a Tercel.

603
00:42:46,173 --> 00:42:48,091
Yeah, that's a Toyota.

604
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:53,388
It has dual side air bags
and a spacious back seat.

605
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,480
-Kiss me!
-Kiss him.

606
00:43:02,564 --> 00:43:04,023
-Okay.
-Good.

607
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:09,320
Hey, thanks, man!

608
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:14,575
Sweet.

609
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:17,995
Looking fresh tonight, pussycat.

610
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,791
Wait. Was that...
Did your hairline just recede?

611
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:25,211
-Hey, where are you goin'?
-Away.

612
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:28,089
-Your sister here?
-Stay away from my sister.

613
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,800
Oh, I'll stay away from your sister.

614
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:33,261
But I can't guarantee
she'll stay away from me.

615
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:37,598
-Fight!
-Fight!

616
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:47,150
You guys, please! Take it outside!

617
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,657
Thank you!

618
00:43:57,077 --> 00:43:59,787
Hey, Kat. Look who found me.

619
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,500
-Bianca, wait.
-Please do not address me in public.

620
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:05,793
No, there's something I need to tell you.

621
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:10,214
I am busy enjoying my adolescence,
so scamper off and do the same.

622
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,466
Bu-bye.

623
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:16,262
Want one?

624
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,599
-What is this?
-Right on, sister!

625
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:22,977
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

626
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,772
I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that
what you're supposed to do at a party?

627
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:28,149
I don't know.
I say do what you want to do.

628
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,234
Funny. You're the only one.

629
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,819
Later.

630
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:47,084
Lord of the dance! Hi, Heather.

631
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:50,004
-Bite me.
-Should've kept the tie.

632
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:53,049
Hey. Hey, have you seen her
around anywhere?

633
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:55,301
-Relax.
-Relax? I'm fine.

634
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,970
Follow the love.

635
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:02,433
Hi, Bianca.

636
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:05,061
Oh, hi, Cameron.

637
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,398
You know Chastity?

638
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:13,694
Yeah. I think
we have art together, right?

639
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:14,946
Neat.

640
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:18,866
So, you...

641
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:21,494
You really look amazing.

642
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:25,706
-Thanks.
-And we all know I look amazing.

643
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:28,334
Yeah.

644
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:32,255
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr Cuervo.

645
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:35,007
I'll see you around, okay?

646
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:49,814
So, I've got
the Sears catalogue thing going,

647
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:53,150
and the tube sock gig,
that is gonna be huge.

648
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:58,406
And I'm up for
a hemorrhoid cream ad next week.

649
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,992
I know it sounds kind of bogus, but...

650
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:03,119
I get to do some acting.

651
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,713
You see what I did there?

652
00:46:14,923 --> 00:46:18,134
That was underwear. I'll show you
the bathing suit one again.

653
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:23,014
You see the difference?

654
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,601
All right, I'll show you guys.

655
00:46:57,466 --> 00:47:00,134
Is it me, or does this party
all of a sudden suck?

656
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:09,060
Really, really,

657
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:10,561
thank you!

658
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,023
Hey. Hey, Kat, why don't you
let me have this one, huh?

659
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:15,900
No! This one's mine.

660
00:47:17,027 --> 00:47:19,987
My man! How did you get her to do it?

661
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:21,781
-Do what?
- Act like a human.

662
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,826
Yeah! All right!

663
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,703
Go!

664
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,834
See this?

665
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:08,119
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

666
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,040
You're not fine. Come on.

667
00:48:14,793 --> 00:48:16,043
I just need to lie down.

668
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:18,421
You lie down and you'll go to sleep.

669
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:21,173
-Sleep is good.
-Not if you have a concussion.

670
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:23,342
Come on. Here, sit down.

671
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:27,221
-Sit.
-Hey, hey, we need to talk.

672
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:30,891
-I'm a little busy right now.
-Can you give me a second?

673
00:48:35,147 --> 00:48:37,356
-What?
-It's off, okay? The whole thing's off.

674
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,525
What are you talking about?

675
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:43,279
She never wanted me.
She wanted Joey the whole time.

676
00:48:43,363 --> 00:48:45,531
Cameron, do you like the girl?

677
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:48,909
-Yeah.
- And is she worth all this trouble?

678
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:50,911
I thought she was, but, you know, I...

679
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,913
Well, she is or she isn't.

680
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:55,583
See, first of all,
Joey is not half the man you are.

681
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,585
Secondly, don't let anyone
ever make you feel

682
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:00,296
like you don't deserve what you want.

683
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,214
Go for it!

684
00:49:06,178 --> 00:49:07,720
-Come on.
-Why?

685
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,690
This is so patronizing.

686
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:22,359
Leave it to you to use
big words when you're smashed.

687
00:49:22,444 --> 00:49:25,446
-I don't think so.
-Kat.

688
00:49:27,282 --> 00:49:30,367
-Why are you doing this?
-I told you. You may have a concussion.

689
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:31,994
You don't care if I never wake up.

690
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,121
-Sure I do.
-Why?

691
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:37,291
Because then I'd have to start
taking out girls who actually like me.

692
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,502
-Like you could find one.
-Oh, see? That, there.

693
00:49:39,586 --> 00:49:41,670
Who needs affection
when I have blind hatred?

694
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:45,216
-I just... Let me sit down for a while.
-All right. There.

695
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,733
-So, why'd you let him get to you?
-Who?

696
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:05,027
-Joey.
-I hate him.

697
00:50:07,155 --> 00:50:10,783
Well, you've chosen the perfect
revenge, mainlining tequila.

698
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,621
-Well, you know what they say.
-Nope. What do they say?

699
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:20,042
No, no, no, no. Kat, come on, wake up!
Look at me!

700
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:23,129
Listen to me, Kat! Open your eyes!

701
00:50:29,052 --> 00:50:30,177
Hey.

702
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:33,347
Your eyes have a little green in them.

703
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:52,783
I don't know if we should go.

704
00:50:52,868 --> 00:50:55,786
Hey, a bunch of us
are going to Jarrett's. Ready?

705
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,372
I have to be home in 20 minutes.

706
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,792
Well, you know I don't have to be home
till 2:00, so...

707
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:05,838
-One more chance.
-Man, I can't.

708
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:08,090
-Damn.
-That's a shame.

709
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,385
-You wanna go?
-Sure.

710
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,554
-Chastity!
-Hey, you passed.

711
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,848
Bitch.

712
00:51:20,437 --> 00:51:22,938
-Hey. Have fun tonight?
-Tons.

713
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:26,192
Hey, Cameron?

714
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:30,529
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?

715
00:51:34,034 --> 00:51:35,743
I should do this.

716
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:37,536
-Do what?
-This!

717
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,582
-Start a band?
-No, install car stereos.

718
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,252
Yeah, start a band.
My father would love that.

719
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:02,603
You don't strike me as the type that
would ask your father for permission.

720
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,106
-Oh, so now you think you know me?
-I'm getting there.

721
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:09,610
The only thing people know
about me is that I'm scary.

722
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:13,614
Yeah, well, I'm no picnic myself.

723
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:25,626
So what's up with your dad?
Is he... Is he a pain in the ass?

724
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,087
No, he just wants me to be
somebody that I'm not.

725
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:29,880
-Who?
-Bianca.

726
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,382
Oh, Bianca.

727
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,180
No offense or anything... I mean
I know everyone "digs" your sister,

728
00:52:38,265 --> 00:52:40,975
but she's without.

729
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:49,733
You know,

730
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,571
you're not as vile
as I thought you were.

731
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,918
Maybe we should do this another time.

732
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:55,591
You never wanted
to go sailing with me, did you?

733
00:53:57,093 --> 00:53:58,385
Yes, I did.

734
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,263
No, you didn't.

735
00:54:03,016 --> 00:54:05,642
Okay, no, not actually...

736
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:08,437
Well, then that's all you had to say.

737
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,108
Have you always been this selfish?

738
00:54:16,237 --> 00:54:17,613
Yes.

739
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:22,868
You know, just 'cause you're beautiful,

740
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:27,122
that doesn't mean that you can
treat people like they don't matter.

741
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:30,209
I mean, I really liked you, okay.

742
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:33,128
I defended you
when people called you conceited,

743
00:54:33,213 --> 00:54:35,297
I helped you when you asked me to,

744
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:39,551
I learnt French for you and then
you just blow me off so you could...

745
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,959
And I'm back in the game!

746
00:55:15,422 --> 00:55:19,716
Kat, me lady.
You sway to the rhythm of me heart.

747
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:21,718
Dance for me, cowgirl.

748
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:25,097
Kat, babe, what do we owe you
for the table dance?

749
00:55:26,224 --> 00:55:28,684
All right, not that I give a damn,
but how was everybody's weekend?

750
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:31,562
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we should ask Kat.

751
00:55:32,147 --> 00:55:34,273
Unless she kicked the crap
out of your dumb butt,

752
00:55:34,357 --> 00:55:36,316
I don't wanna hear about it.

753
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:41,155
Okay, let's open up our books
to page 73, Sonnet 141.

754
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:42,698
And listen up.

755
00:55:42,782 --> 00:55:44,741
"In faith, I do not love thee
with mine eyes

756
00:55:44,826 --> 00:55:46,952
"For they in thee
a thousand errors note

757
00:55:47,036 --> 00:55:49,163
"But 'tis my heart that loves
what they despise

758
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,082
"Who, in despite of view,
is pleas'd to dote"

759
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,879
Now, I know Shakespeare's
a dead white guy,

760
00:55:56,963 --> 00:55:59,506
but he knows his shit,
so we can overlook that.

761
00:55:59,591 --> 00:56:02,342
I want you all to write
your own version of this sonnet.

762
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:07,806
Yes, Miss I-Have-An-Opinion-
About-Everything?

763
00:56:07,974 --> 00:56:10,601
Do you want this in iambic pentameter?

764
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:13,145
You're not gonna fight me on this?

765
00:56:13,229 --> 00:56:15,981
No, I think
it's a really good assignment.

766
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,317
You're just
messin' with me, aren't you?

767
00:56:18,401 --> 00:56:21,236
No, I'm really looking forward
to writing it.

768
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:22,571
Get out of my class.

769
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:24,990
-What?
-Out. Get out!

770
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:34,208
-Thanks, Mr Morgan.
-Shut up.

771
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:00,817
Hey. Cool picture.

772
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,571
What's that collar for? Is that
to keep him from licking his stitches?

773
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:12,287
Kidding. No, because I know
you're a fan of Shakespeare.

774
00:57:12,372 --> 00:57:15,666
More than a fan. We're involved.

775
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:17,793
Okay.

776
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:22,422
"Who could refrain
That had a heart to love

777
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:26,760
-"and in that heart..."
-"Courage to make love known."

778
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:30,055
-That's Macbeth, right?
-Right.

779
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:35,394
So, listen, I... I have this friend,

780
00:57:36,437 --> 00:57:38,438
and he likes your friend...

781
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:47,656
What did you do to her?

782
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,033
I didn't do anything. She would've been
too drunk to remember.

783
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,910
But the plan was working.

784
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:54,788
What do you care?
I thought you wanted out.

785
00:57:55,123 --> 00:57:57,583
Yeah, well, I did, but

786
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,793
that was until she kissed me.

787
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:03,255
-Where?
-In the car.

788
00:58:06,676 --> 00:58:07,759
Sorry.

789
00:58:07,844 --> 00:58:09,678
-Dweeb! Putz!
-I'm sorry.

790
00:58:09,762 --> 00:58:11,680
All right, I talked to her.

791
00:58:11,764 --> 00:58:13,015
-I got the scoop.
-What'd she say?

792
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,559
"Hates him with the fire
of a thousand suns."

793
00:58:15,643 --> 00:58:17,477
That's a direct quote.

794
00:58:17,979 --> 00:58:21,148
Thanks, Michael.
That's very comforting of you.

795
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:25,068
We don't know.
She could need a day to cool off.

796
00:58:31,951 --> 00:58:33,327
Maybe two.

797
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:44,296
Hey!

798
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,175
Can you imagine who would go
to that antiquated mating ritual?

799
00:58:48,384 --> 00:58:50,719
I would, but I don't have a date.

800
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:52,512
Do you really want
to get all dressed up,

801
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:56,016
so some Drakkar Noir-wearing dexter
with a boner can feel you up

802
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,311
while you're forced to listen
to a band that by definition blows?

803
00:58:59,395 --> 00:59:01,313
All right, all right, we won't go.

804
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:03,982
It's not like I've got a dress anyway.

805
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:06,902
You're looking at this
from entirely the wrong perspective.

806
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:08,487
We're making a statement.

807
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:11,990
Oh, goody.
Something new and different for us.

808
00:59:29,258 --> 00:59:32,719
-Hey there, Cupid.
-Hi, Joey.

809
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:36,515
You're concentrating awfully hard
considering it's gym class.

810
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:40,560
-Can I help you?
-I want to talk to you about prom.

811
00:59:46,192 --> 00:59:49,194
Look, you know the deal.
I can't go if Kat doesn't go.

812
00:59:49,278 --> 00:59:51,196
Your sister is going.

813
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,368
-Since when?
-Let's just say I'm taking care of it.

814
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:04,918
This should take care of the
flowers, the limo, the tux, everything.

815
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:07,462
Just make sure she gets to the prom.

816
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,133
Do you know what?
I'm sick of playing your little game.

817
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:13,051
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

818
01:00:13,136 --> 01:00:16,555
You sick of, let's say, 300?

819
01:01:39,222 --> 01:01:41,223
Excuse me. Have you
seen The Feminine Mystique?

820
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:42,432
I've lost my copy.

821
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:45,602
-What are you doing here?
-I heard there was a poetry reading.

822
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:47,604
-You're so...
-Charming.

823
01:01:48,523 --> 01:01:50,315
Wholesome.

824
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:51,900
Unwelcome.

825
01:01:54,654 --> 01:01:56,988
You're not as mean as you think
you are, you know that?

826
01:01:57,073 --> 01:01:59,491
And you're not as badass
as you think you are.

827
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:01,910
Someone still has her panties in a twist.

828
01:02:01,994 --> 01:02:05,247
Don't for one minute think that you had
any effect whatsoever on my panties.

829
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:06,790
Then what did I have an effect on?

830
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:09,668
Other than my upchuck reflex, nothing.

831
01:02:22,181 --> 01:02:24,349
You're right, she's still pissed.

832
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,476
"Sweet love, renew thy force"

833
01:02:26,561 --> 01:02:30,522
Hey! Don't say shit like that to me.
People can hear you.

834
01:02:30,606 --> 01:02:32,482
Look, you embarrassed the girl.

835
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:36,194
Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity
and even the score.

836
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:42,534
Listen, don't say shit like that to him.

837
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:44,703
People can hear you.

838
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:19,029
You're just too good to be true

839
01:03:19,113 --> 01:03:22,908
Can't take my eyes off of you

840
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:25,952
You'd be like heaven to touch

841
01:03:26,621 --> 01:03:29,539
l wanna hold you so much

842
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,793
At long last love has arrived

843
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:37,547
And l thank God l'm alive

844
01:03:38,424 --> 01:03:41,343
You're just too good to be true

845
01:03:42,178 --> 01:03:46,056
Can't take my eyes off of you

846
01:04:03,032 --> 01:04:05,700
l love you, baby

847
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:09,621
And if it's quite all right
l need you, baby

848
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:13,959
To warm the lonely night
l love you, baby

849
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:18,380
Trust in me when l say

850
01:04:18,506 --> 01:04:21,049
Oh, pretty baby

851
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:24,886
Don't bring me down, l pray
Oh, pretty baby

852
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:30,225
Now that l found you, stay
and let me love you, baby

853
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:35,146
Let me love you

854
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,861
You look pretty nervous.

855
01:05:23,738 --> 01:05:25,447
Yes, sir.

856
01:05:25,573 --> 01:05:27,615
You're sweating like a pig.

857
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:29,784
Yes, sir.

858
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:32,287
Your eyes are all bloodshot.

859
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:34,956
Yes, sir.

860
01:05:35,082 --> 01:05:37,459
You've got pot, don't you?

861
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:45,633
I'm confiscating this.

862
01:05:55,144 --> 01:05:56,561
This, too.

863
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:04,069
Mr Chapin, can I talk to you
for a second?

864
01:06:04,153 --> 01:06:05,737
What can I do for you, Stratford?

865
01:06:05,821 --> 01:06:08,740
I have some ideas on how
we can improve the girls' soccer team.

866
01:06:08,824 --> 01:06:11,159
Great! Let's talk about it later.

867
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:18,249
The window.

868
01:06:21,003 --> 01:06:23,671
As you know, we have
a really big game with Hillcrest High...

869
01:06:23,756 --> 01:06:25,256
Your bicep is huge!

870
01:06:25,341 --> 01:06:28,009
Oh, my God.
The other one's even bigger.

871
01:06:28,344 --> 01:06:30,678
You don't take steroids, do you,
because I've heard steroids

872
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:33,348
can severely disintegrate
your package?

873
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:36,267
Not that I'm thinking about
your package.

874
01:06:36,352 --> 01:06:38,478
-That's not the point.
-Let's hope not.

875
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:42,273
The point is they kick our butts
every year.

876
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:46,986
I was thinking, I devised a plan that
will enable us to finally defeat them.

877
01:06:47,113 --> 01:06:48,530
Which is?

878
01:06:48,948 --> 01:06:51,866
-That thing that you taught us.
-What thing?

879
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:54,202
-Misdirection.
-I taught you that?

880
01:06:54,286 --> 01:06:58,039
Yeah, you or Siegfried or Roy?
Anyway, that's not important.

881
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,792
The... Think about it.

882
01:07:00,876 --> 01:07:03,545
They're looking left
and we're running right.

883
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:05,713
Bang, we score. We win.

884
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:08,550
Okay, but how do we get 'em
to look left?

885
01:07:10,386 --> 01:07:11,886
Like this.

886
01:07:19,395 --> 01:07:21,729
Okay. Well,

887
01:07:23,023 --> 01:07:25,400
now that you've seen "the plan,"

888
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:29,988
I'm gonna go and show "the plan"
to someone else.

889
01:07:32,032 --> 01:07:33,158
Okay.

890
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:35,034
Hi.

891
01:07:43,752 --> 01:07:46,254
I can't thank you enough
for helping me sneak out of detention.

892
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,256
-Very cool.
-No problem.

893
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:51,593
I thought for sure I was busted when I
was climbing out that window, I tell ya.

894
01:07:51,677 --> 01:07:54,012
So, how did you keep him distracted?

895
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:56,848
I dazzled him with my wits.

896
01:08:00,561 --> 01:08:02,937
-So, what's your excuse?
-For?

897
01:08:03,272 --> 01:08:05,231
For acting the way we do?

898
01:08:06,275 --> 01:08:08,526
I don't like to do what people expect.

899
01:08:08,611 --> 01:08:11,779
Why should I live up to other people's
expectations instead of my own?

900
01:08:11,906 --> 01:08:15,200
So, you disappoint 'em from the start
and then you're covered, right?

901
01:08:16,452 --> 01:08:18,453
Something like that.

902
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:22,290
-Then you screwed up.
-How?

903
01:08:24,084 --> 01:08:26,127
You never disappointed me.

904
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,471
Are you up for it?

905
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:38,640
Up for what?

906
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:03,474
All right, come on.

907
01:10:18,574 --> 01:10:20,575
No, none of that stuff is true.

908
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:24,078
-State trooper.
-Fallacy. Dead guy in the parking lot?

909
01:10:24,204 --> 01:10:26,080
Rumor. The duck?

910
01:10:26,165 --> 01:10:28,416
Hearsay. Bobby Ridgeway's balls?

911
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:31,252
Fact. But he deserved it.
He tried to grope me in the lunch line.

912
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:33,379
-Fair enough.
-The accent?

913
01:10:33,756 --> 01:10:37,258
It's real.
I lived in Australia until I was 10.

914
01:10:37,593 --> 01:10:40,386
-With the Pygmies?
-Close.

915
01:10:40,596 --> 01:10:42,096
With my mom.

916
01:10:43,766 --> 01:10:46,934
Where were you last year?
I know the porn career is a lie.

917
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:48,353
Do you?

918
01:10:56,612 --> 01:10:59,405
-Tell me something true.
-Something true.

919
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:03,910
I hate peas.

920
01:11:04,453 --> 01:11:08,039
No. Something real.
Something no one else knows.

921
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,625
Okay. You're sweet,

922
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:14,796
and sexy,

923
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,633
and completely hot for me.

924
01:11:20,302 --> 01:11:23,054
You are amazingly self-assured.
Has anyone ever told you that?

925
01:11:23,138 --> 01:11:25,973
I tell myself that every day, actually.

926
01:11:29,103 --> 01:11:32,897
-Go to the prom with me.
-Is that a request or a command?

927
01:11:32,981 --> 01:11:35,149
Come on. Go with me.

928
01:11:35,651 --> 01:11:38,653
-No.
-No? Why not?

929
01:11:39,154 --> 01:11:41,155
Because I don't want to.
Because it's a stupid tradition.

930
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:43,991
Come on.
People won't expect you to go.

931
01:11:44,827 --> 01:11:46,953
Why are you pushing this?

932
01:11:49,331 --> 01:11:51,124
What's in it for you?

933
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:58,256
So now I need to have a motive
to want to be with you?

934
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,841
You tell me.

935
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,344
You need therapy, you know that?

936
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,972
Has anyone ever told you that?

937
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:08,683
-Answer the question, Patrick.
-Nothing!

938
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:09,767
There is nothing in it for me,

939
01:12:09,852 --> 01:12:12,437
just the pleasure of your company.
Okay?

940
01:12:37,337 --> 01:12:40,298
Wait. Wait a minute.
That... That's not on this page.

941
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,088
Seven!

942
01:13:24,092 --> 01:13:25,259
Good.

943
01:13:29,598 --> 01:13:31,891
-Daddy?
-Hi, honey.

944
01:13:32,434 --> 01:13:37,188
I'd like to discuss tomorrow night
with you. As you know, it's the prom...

945
01:13:43,028 --> 01:13:45,446
The prom? Kat has a date?

946
01:13:46,281 --> 01:13:47,782
Well, no.

947
01:13:49,117 --> 01:13:50,201
Don't think you're fooling me.

948
01:13:50,285 --> 01:13:51,619
I know who you wanna
bend the rules for.

949
01:13:51,703 --> 01:13:53,621
It's that hot-rod Joey.

950
01:13:53,705 --> 01:13:55,373
What's a hot rod?

951
01:13:56,124 --> 01:14:00,545
It's a... If your sister's not going,
you're not going. End of story.

952
01:14:01,547 --> 01:14:03,297
Okay, let's review.

953
01:14:03,423 --> 01:14:06,467
Kat, not interested, me, dying to go.

954
01:14:06,718 --> 01:14:08,803
Do you know what happens at proms?

955
01:14:08,887 --> 01:14:11,639
Yes, Daddy. We'll dance,
we'll kiss, we'll come home.

956
01:14:11,723 --> 01:14:14,225
It's not quite the crisis situation
you imagine.

957
01:14:14,309 --> 01:14:16,394
Kissing, huh?
That's what you think happens?

958
01:14:16,478 --> 01:14:17,562
Got news for you.

959
01:14:17,646 --> 01:14:22,149
Kissing isn't what keeps me up to
my elbows in placenta all day long.

960
01:14:22,651 --> 01:14:25,570
Can we for two seconds ignore the fact
that you're severely unhinged,

961
01:14:25,654 --> 01:14:28,155
and discuss my need for a night
of teenage normalcy?

962
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,325
What's normal?
Those damn Dawson's River kids,

963
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:34,161
sleeping in each other's beds
and whatnot?

964
01:14:34,746 --> 01:14:36,914
-Daddy, that is so not...
-Got news for ya.

965
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:38,666
I'm down. I've got the 4-1 -1 .

966
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,085
And you are not going out
and getting jiggy with some boy.

967
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:43,671
I don't care how dope his ride is.

968
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:51,095
My mama didn't raise no fool.

969
01:14:52,514 --> 01:14:54,015
Thanks, Bill.

970
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:58,686
Ridiculous amounts of love
across this nation worldwide.

971
01:14:59,313 --> 01:15:00,521
Believe it.

972
01:15:01,857 --> 01:15:03,774
This is the true story.

973
01:15:05,027 --> 01:15:06,110
Seattle.

974
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:10,448
Come in.

975
01:15:16,705 --> 01:15:18,372
Listen, I know...

976
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:24,545
I know you hate having to sit at home
because I'm not Suzy High School.

977
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:26,881
-Like you care.
-I do care.

978
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:30,718
But I'm a firm believer in doing
something for your own reasons,

979
01:15:30,802 --> 01:15:32,803
and not someone else's.

980
01:15:33,722 --> 01:15:35,723
Well, I wish I had that luxury.

981
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,559
You know, I'm the only sophomore
that got asked to go to the prom,

982
01:15:38,644 --> 01:15:41,562
and I can't go
because you don't feel like it.

983
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:48,819
Joey never told you
that we went out, did he?

984
01:15:48,904 --> 01:15:52,406
-Yeah, okay.
-In ninth, for a month.

985
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:02,375
-Why?
-Because he was, like, such a babe.

986
01:16:03,418 --> 01:16:06,212
-But you hate Joey.
-Now I do.

987
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:08,589
So, what happened?

988
01:16:15,931 --> 01:16:17,848
Please tell me you're joking.

989
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:21,352
Just once, right after Mom left.

990
01:16:22,604 --> 01:16:25,022
Everyone was doing it, so...

991
01:16:25,107 --> 01:16:26,440
I did it.

992
01:16:27,442 --> 01:16:30,778
Afterwards I told him I didn't want to
any more because I wasn't ready,

993
01:16:30,904 --> 01:16:33,406
and he got pissed and he dumped me.

994
01:16:34,616 --> 01:16:36,450
After that I swore I'd never do anything

995
01:16:36,535 --> 01:16:38,369
just because everyone else
was doing it.

996
01:16:38,453 --> 01:16:40,121
And I haven't since,

997
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:42,373
with the exception of Bogey's party

998
01:16:42,457 --> 01:16:45,084
and my stunning
digestive pyrotechnics.

999
01:16:47,295 --> 01:16:50,464
How is it possible
that I did not know about this?

1000
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:52,383
I warned him that if he told anyone,

1001
01:16:52,467 --> 01:16:56,137
the cheerleading squad would find out
how tiny his dick is.

1002
01:16:58,974 --> 01:17:01,809
Okay, so why didn't you tell me?

1003
01:17:03,645 --> 01:17:06,731
I wanted to let you
make up your mind about him.

1004
01:17:07,983 --> 01:17:10,943
Then why did you help Daddy
hold me hostage?

1005
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:14,655
It's not like I'm stupid enough
to repeat your mistakes.

1006
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,657
I guess I thought I was protecting you.

1007
01:17:16,783 --> 01:17:19,744
By not letting me experience
anything for myself?

1008
01:17:19,828 --> 01:17:22,496
Not all experiences are good, Bianca.

1009
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:24,582
You can't always trust
the people you want to.

1010
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:27,251
Well, I guess I'll never know, will I?

1011
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,131
Ladies with thinning hair or bald spots,

1012
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:18,719
G.L.H. solves the problem instantly.
G.L.H. is not a paint or a cover-up.

1013
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:22,890
It's an amazing powder that clings
to the tiniest hairs on your head.

1014
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:25,059
It actually builds on itself,

1015
01:18:25,143 --> 01:18:27,728
leaving you with great,
great-looking hair.

1016
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:29,480
And the G.L.H. hair system
is not expensive.

1017
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:30,648
Interesting.

1018
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:33,150
Order your G.L.H. hair package now.

1019
01:18:33,902 --> 01:18:36,153
Bye, Dad. I'm going to the prom.

1020
01:18:36,696 --> 01:18:37,905
Funny, sweetie.

1021
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:41,325
It instantly covers your bald spot
leaving you with great looking hair.

1022
01:18:45,872 --> 01:18:47,998
-What's that?
-A prom dress.

1023
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,876
I seem to be hearing that word
a lot lately.

1024
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:59,260
-Hi.
-Wow. I...

1025
01:19:03,014 --> 01:19:04,557
Wow.

1026
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:07,017
-Bye, Daddy.
-Stop.

1027
01:19:07,102 --> 01:19:09,895
Turn. Explain.

1028
01:19:11,273 --> 01:19:14,608
Okay. Remember how you said
I could date if Kat dated?

1029
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:16,944
Well, she found this guy
who's actually kind of perfect for her

1030
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:18,445
which is perfect for me,

1031
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:21,365
because Cameron asked me to go to
the prom and I really, really wanna go,

1032
01:19:21,449 --> 01:19:24,618
and since Kat went, I guess I'm allowed
to, based on the aforementioned rule,

1033
01:19:24,744 --> 01:19:26,787
and its previous stipulations, of course.

1034
01:19:27,622 --> 01:19:29,540
-Nice to meet you.
-Let's go.

1035
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:34,879
I know every cop in town, Bucko!

1036
01:19:38,967 --> 01:19:40,718
This is not good.

1037
01:20:22,344 --> 01:20:23,510
Wow.

1038
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:26,347
You, too.

1039
01:20:29,434 --> 01:20:31,018
Where'd you get a tux
at the last minute?

1040
01:20:31,102 --> 01:20:34,271
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.

1041
01:20:34,648 --> 01:20:35,856
Where'd you get the dress?

1042
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:38,525
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.

1043
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:45,950
Listen, I'm really sorry
that I questioned your motives.

1044
01:20:46,534 --> 01:20:48,160
I was wrong.

1045
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:51,705
You're forgiven.

1046
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:55,668
Okay.

1047
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,046
-Ready for the prom?
-Yes, ma'am.

1048
01:21:12,727 --> 01:21:16,397
Hi, Mr Stratford. I'm Joey.
I'm here to pick up Bianca.

1049
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:39,253
-Have you seen him?
-Who?

1050
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:42,047
William.
He asked me to meet him here.

1051
01:21:42,924 --> 01:21:44,675
Oh, Mandella,
please tell me you haven't

1052
01:21:44,759 --> 01:21:47,386
progressed to full-on hallucinations.

1053
01:22:10,035 --> 01:22:12,369
-Milady.
-Good sir.

1054
01:22:36,936 --> 01:22:38,645
Oh, my God, it's...

1055
01:22:40,398 --> 01:22:42,316
I called in a favor!

1056
01:23:39,707 --> 01:23:41,208
What are you doing here?

1057
01:23:41,334 --> 01:23:43,794
I know you didn't think you were
the only sophomore at the prom.

1058
01:23:43,878 --> 01:23:45,671
Joey just picked me up.

1059
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:48,799
Oh, well, congratulations.
He's all yours.

1060
01:23:48,883 --> 01:23:50,509
Very generous, princess.

1061
01:23:50,593 --> 01:23:53,804
And just so you know,
Joey only liked you for one reason.

1062
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:55,764
He even had a bet going
with his friends.

1063
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:58,058
He was gonna nail you tonight.

1064
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:05,274
-Milwaukee.
-What?

1065
01:24:05,525 --> 01:24:08,569
That's where I was last year.
I wasn't in jail.

1066
01:24:08,736 --> 01:24:09,987
I don't know Marilyn Manson

1067
01:24:10,071 --> 01:24:13,699
and I didn't sleep with a Spice Girl,
I don't think.

1068
01:24:13,867 --> 01:24:17,578
You see, my grandpa, he was ill
so I spent most of the year on his couch

1069
01:24:17,704 --> 01:24:20,956
watching Wheel ofFortune
and making SpaghettiOs.

1070
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,208
End of story.

1071
01:24:23,793 --> 01:24:25,127
No way.

1072
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,216
Hey. What's Bianca doing here
with that cheese dick?

1073
01:24:31,426 --> 01:24:36,263
I didn't pay you to take out Kat so some
little punk could snake me with Bianca.

1074
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:42,394
Nothing in it for you, huh?

1075
01:24:53,781 --> 01:24:55,908
The shit hath hitteth

1076
01:24:55,992 --> 01:24:58,118
the faneth.

1077
01:25:01,956 --> 01:25:05,083
Joey, pal, compadre?

1078
01:25:08,129 --> 01:25:11,381
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

1079
01:25:11,466 --> 01:25:14,092
You and that little bitch.

1080
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:18,305
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

1081
01:25:20,475 --> 01:25:22,643
Oh, come on! Get up, you little punk!

1082
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:30,984
Shit, Bianca!
I'm shooting a nose spray ad tomorrow!

1083
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:34,529
That's for making my date bleed!
That's for my sister!

1084
01:25:35,657 --> 01:25:37,366
And that's for me.

1085
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,458
Are you okay?

1086
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,169
Never been better.

1087
01:25:58,304 --> 01:25:59,346
Would you give me a chance...

1088
01:25:59,472 --> 01:26:02,516
You were paid to take me out
by the one person I truly hate.

1089
01:26:02,642 --> 01:26:04,643
I knew this was a set-up!

1090
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:07,145
Kat, it wasn't like that, okay.

1091
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,898
What was it like, a down payment now
and a bonus for sleeping with me?

1092
01:26:10,024 --> 01:26:12,985
No, I didn't care about the money!
I cared...

1093
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,654
I cared about you.

1094
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:19,866
You are so not who I thought you were.

1095
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:04,536
You want?

1096
01:27:04,746 --> 01:27:05,954
Thanks.

1097
01:27:07,248 --> 01:27:11,251
So, you sure you don't want
to go sailing with us? It'll be fun.

1098
01:27:11,711 --> 01:27:13,587
No, I'm fine.

1099
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:19,092
Look, I don't know if I ever thanked you
for going last night,

1100
01:27:20,428 --> 01:27:22,763
but it really meant a lot to me.

1101
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:26,391
I'm glad.

1102
01:27:28,478 --> 01:27:30,729
-Hey.
-Hey.

1103
01:27:30,938 --> 01:27:32,731
You ready?

1104
01:27:34,317 --> 01:27:36,068
-See you later.
-Bye.

1105
01:27:38,071 --> 01:27:40,572
-Is... Is she okay?
-I hope so.

1106
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,456
Where's your sister going?

1107
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:53,418
She's meeting some bikers,
big ones, full of sperm.

1108
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:56,588
Funny.

1109
01:27:58,674 --> 01:28:01,593
So, tell me about this dance.
Was it hoppin'?

1110
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:03,887
Parts of it.

1111
01:28:03,971 --> 01:28:05,263
Which parts?

1112
01:28:06,099 --> 01:28:09,059
The part where Bianca
beat the hell out of some guy.

1113
01:28:09,143 --> 01:28:10,560
Bianca did what?

1114
01:28:10,645 --> 01:28:13,855
What's the matter,
upset that I rubbed off on her?

1115
01:28:14,649 --> 01:28:16,149
No, impressed.

1116
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,739
Fathers don't like to admit it
when their daughters

1117
01:28:22,824 --> 01:28:24,116
are capable of running their own lives.

1118
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,701
It means we've become spectators.

1119
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:35,293
Bianca still lets me play a few innings.
You've had me on the bench for years.

1120
01:28:37,672 --> 01:28:41,049
And when you go to Sarah Lawrence,
I won't even be able to watch the game.

1121
01:28:43,344 --> 01:28:44,845
When I go?

1122
01:28:46,013 --> 01:28:49,015
Oh, boy. Don't tell me
you changed your mind.

1123
01:28:50,017 --> 01:28:52,185
I already sent 'em a cheque.

1124
01:29:09,245 --> 01:29:12,789
All right, I assume everyone
has found time to complete their poem,

1125
01:29:12,874 --> 01:29:14,708
except for Mr Donner,

1126
01:29:15,209 --> 01:29:16,877
who has an excuse.

1127
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:21,047
Shaft, lose the glasses.

1128
01:29:24,927 --> 01:29:28,263
All right, anyone brave enough
to read theirs aloud?

1129
01:29:36,731 --> 01:29:37,939
I will.

1130
01:29:40,401 --> 01:29:41,902
Lord, here we go.

1131
01:29:50,786 --> 01:29:54,164
"I hate the way you talk to me
and the way you cut your hair

1132
01:29:54,248 --> 01:29:58,668
"I hate the way you drive my car
I hate it when you stare

1133
01:29:58,753 --> 01:30:02,631
"I hate your big dumb combat boots
and the way you read my mind

1134
01:30:02,757 --> 01:30:06,426
"I hate you so much it makes me sick
It even makes me rhyme

1135
01:30:08,721 --> 01:30:11,681
"I hate it...
I hate the way you're always right

1136
01:30:11,766 --> 01:30:13,892
"I hate it when you lie

1137
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:18,063
"I hate it when you make me laugh
even worse when you make me cry

1138
01:30:19,607 --> 01:30:23,693
"I hate it when you're not around
and the fact that you didn't call

1139
01:30:23,778 --> 01:30:27,447
"But mostly, I hate the way
I don't hate you, not even close

1140
01:30:27,573 --> 01:30:30,158
"not even a little bit, not even at all"

1141
01:31:12,952 --> 01:31:16,371
-Nice, huh?
- A Fender Strat?

1142
01:31:16,998 --> 01:31:18,415
Is it for me?

1143
01:31:18,499 --> 01:31:22,252
Yeah, I thought you could use it,
you know, when you start your band.

1144
01:31:22,336 --> 01:31:25,046
Besides,
I had some extra cash, you know.

1145
01:31:25,172 --> 01:31:28,633
Some asshole paid me
to take out this really great girl.

1146
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:31,636
Is that right?

1147
01:31:32,179 --> 01:31:35,640
Yeah, but I screwed up. I... I fell for her.

1148
01:31:38,227 --> 01:31:39,519
Really?

1149
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,314
It's not every day you find a girl

1150
01:31:42,398 --> 01:31:45,692
who'll flash someone
to get you out of detention.

1151
01:31:46,527 --> 01:31:47,736
Oh, God.

1152
01:31:56,037 --> 01:31:59,748
You can't just buy me a guitar
every time you screw up, you know.

1153
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:01,583
Yeah, I know.

1154
01:32:02,543 --> 01:32:06,254
But there's always drums and bass
and maybe even one day a tambourine.

1155
01:32:14,263 --> 01:32:15,388
And don't just think you can...

1156
01:34:46,707 --> 01:34:51,169
No offense. I know everyone "digs"
your sister and all,

1157
01:34:51,378 --> 01:34:52,921
but she's without.

1158
01:34:54,882 --> 01:34:58,843
You know, you're not as vile
as I thought you were.

1159
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:10,730
You suck.

1160
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:14,526
Okay. Let's go!

1161
01:35:16,445 --> 01:35:18,446
You're just messin' with me,
aren't you?

1162
01:35:18,572 --> 01:35:20,615
No, I'm really looking forward
to doing it.

1163
01:35:20,741 --> 01:35:21,991
Go see Miss Perky.

1164
01:35:22,076 --> 01:35:24,744
-What?
-Go. Perky's. Go, now.

1165
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:27,747
Once again.
"Perky, now" is the second one.

1166
01:35:27,873 --> 01:35:30,625
-Perky's now. Perky's, now.
-Right away.

1167
01:35:30,751 --> 01:35:32,460
-Now, Perky's.
-Hey, hey.

1168
01:35:32,586 --> 01:35:35,338
-Now, Perky's. Perky's now.
-At the beginning of the shot.

1169
01:35:35,422 --> 01:35:36,798
Perk...

1170
01:35:40,386 --> 01:35:43,638
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr Cuervo.

1171
01:35:45,099 --> 01:35:47,141
I'll see you around, okay?

1172
01:35:57,570 --> 01:36:00,321
Don't worry. There's better for you,

1173
01:36:00,489 --> 01:36:02,282
and it's right here.

1174
01:36:02,825 --> 01:36:05,159
Come here.
No, I wanted you for so long.

1175
01:36:07,746 --> 01:36:10,999
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.

1176
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,418
You and that little bitch.

1177
01:36:14,587 --> 01:36:18,172
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.

1178
01:36:23,262 --> 01:36:24,512
What, are you kidding me?

1179
01:36:30,477 --> 01:36:33,688
-I'm driving, so I pick the tunes.
-And it's my car.

1180
01:36:36,984 --> 01:36:39,527
I want some coffee!

1181
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:55,376
Could I get a prophylactic?

1182
01:36:55,544 --> 01:36:57,337
A prophylactic.

1183
01:36:59,632 --> 01:37:02,592
-Let go!
-How could you set me up like that?

1184
01:37:02,676 --> 01:37:04,510
Oh, God, I just wanted...

1185
01:37:04,637 --> 01:37:06,638
To completely damage me,
send me to therapy forever?

1186
01:37:06,722 --> 01:37:09,140
-No, I just wanted...
-Ladies.

1187
01:37:12,019 --> 01:37:13,853
Shall we go to my office?

1188
01:37:16,649 --> 01:37:18,691
Oh, my God!
