[principal] It is a great moment.

88
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:58,000
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,875
The iron youth of Germany.

90
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,875
My friends,

91
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,166
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

92
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Your deeds will be the water

93
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,791
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

94
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,000
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

95
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,958
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,458
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

97
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,750
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with hon our and respect.

However, take heed of this.

100
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,458
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,208
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

102
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,666
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

103
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,875
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

104
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,833
For modern war is like a game of chess.

105
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,416
It is never about an individual soldier.

106
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,833
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

107
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,620
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

108
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,625
And by going to the front line
in Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

109
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,416
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

110
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,125
finally march on Paris!

111
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,666
Yeah!

112
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,041

the future of <i>Deutschland,</i>

114
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,125

116
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,916
Yeah!

117
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,916
Therefore, off to the camps

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,666

to the 78th Reserve Infantry Regiment.

182
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,083
We are now on the Western Front.

183
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,666
- Welcome to Paris!
- Yeah! Welcome to Paris!

184
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,125
[engine sounds]

185
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,208
[medic] Ah!

186
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,958
Down there! Down there!

187
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,625
Down there! This way!

188
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,945
- [horn honks]
- [medic] This way!

189
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,031
- [soldier] Go on! Over there on the right!
- [lieutenant] Damn it, what happened?

190
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,291
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 p.m.

191
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
That you may, but on foot.

192
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,975
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,517
With all due respect, I have orders...

194
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,500
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

195
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,583
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

196
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,875
Get out right now, will you?

197
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,583
[horse neighs]

198
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,000
[lieutenant] Everyone, get up.

199
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,291
Come on, get on with it.

200
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,125
You heard the staff surgeon.

201
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,166
[heavy breathing]

202
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,166
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

203
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Keep moving.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,541
- Franz Müller, correct?
- Yes.

205
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,125
The supreme army command

206
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,916
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,059
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

208
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,403
- <i>Jawohl,</i> sir.
- Then walk quicker

209
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,578
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

210
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,958
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,125
[lieutenant] Hurry up.

212
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,708
We're not at a tea party here.

213
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,708
- [explosion sounds]
- [shouting]

214
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,125
[lieutenant] Gas!

215
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,958
- Gas!
- [soldiers] Gas!

216
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,666
[lieutenant] Gas!

217
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,958
[soldiers] Gas!

218
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,833
[soldier] Gas masks on!

219
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

220
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,875
If the French could aim better,

221
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,291
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

222
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,250
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

223
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

224
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,125
- [horse neighs]
- [lieutenant] Eyes straight ahead.

225
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,708
[heavy breathing]

226
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,333
[horse neighs]

227
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,666
- Are you deaf?
- [Paul] No, sir.

228
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,458
I was just trying to put my mask on.

229
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,500
Paul Bäumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

230
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,416
[thunder rumbles]

231
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,041
You should eat something, man.

232
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,375
Attention! Gas masks off!

233
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,333
[soldier] Gas masks off!

234
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,500
[lieutenant] Not you.

235
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,041
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

236
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
Both you and that useless pig.

237
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
Fall in line. March.

238
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,875
[soldier] Fall in line!

239
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
Stay together and keep moving!

240
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,291
[heavy breathing]

241
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,166
[lieutenant] Come on, hurry up!

242
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,083
[soldier] Go!

243
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,166
[thunder rumbles]

244
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,291
[gunfire sounds]

245
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,958
[explosions sound]

246
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,166
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

247
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,000
Next time, you carry mine.

248
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,750
[heavy breathing]

249
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,250
[lieutenant] Congratulations, soldiers.

250
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,166
This is your home now.

251
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,250
Helmets off.

252
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,541
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

253
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,416
We were under barrage all night.

254
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,583
The men are a mess.

255
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,666
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

256
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,791
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

257
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,833
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

258
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,375
[Steinberger] Get in line
to bail the water!

259
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,208
What are you waiting for, Bäumer?

260
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,083
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

261
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,666
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

262
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,291
[lieutenant] Come on, all of you!

263
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,958
It will always snap it up.

264
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
Give a man power...

265
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,333
Man is a beast.

266
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,583
Drink.

267
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,375
[Steinberger] Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

268
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,125
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

269
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,125
[gunfire and explosions continue]

270
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,250
[grunting]

271
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,125
Sorry.

272
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,041
Forget it.

273
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,458
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

274
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,541
Just shut up, Ludwig.

275
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

276
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,750
Stick them down your underwear.

277
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,458
It always works for me.

278
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,875
[sombre music playing]

279
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,545
[Albert] That will make it shoot better,
will it?

280
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,416
[laughs]

281
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,836
- [Paul] Did you hear that?
- [Albert] Hear what?

282
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,708
[Paul] That sound. Listen.

283
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,041
[Albert] There's nothing there.

284
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,958
[Paul shushes]

285
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,291
Our first French to shoot.

286
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,291
Calm down, Paulchen. [Laughs]

287
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,706
There's someone out there.

288
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,791
[whispering] Who's there?

289
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,375
Hey.

290
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,915
[in French] Show yourself!

291
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,708
[gunshots]

292
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,333
[metal clangs]

293
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,416
[in English] Oh, no, no, no!

294
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,333
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

295
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,375
- [Albert] No, Paul. No.
- [soldier] What's going on?

296
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,541
[Albert] You're fine.

297
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,875
[groans]

298
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:03,916
What is it?

299
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,333
The others, over there. They shot at me.

300
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,875
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

301
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Huh?

302
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,791
From now on, keep your heads down.

303
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,184
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

304
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,328
move ten meters to the left.

305
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,125
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

306
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,875
Yeah.

307
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,666
[grunts]

308
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,291
Come on. Paul.

309
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,791
[sombre violin music playing]

310
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,291
[explosion sounds]

311
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,083
[soldier] Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

312
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,958
[shouting]

313
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,083
[soldier] Here!

314
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,333
Bäumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

315
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Into the bunker!

316
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,875
Inside! Inside! Inside!

317
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,041
[explosions continue]

318
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,458
"Be careful what you eat."

319
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,000
That's what my mother said. [Laughs]

320
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,176
- We'll always be together, won't we?
- Yeah.

321
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,791
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

322
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:25,166
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

323
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,490
- [shushes]
- I need to go home.

324
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,208
[coughing]

325
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,208
Creeping barrage.

326
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,208
What?

327
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,458
Every couple of minutes,

328
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,416
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

329
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,916
And directly after that,

330
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,583
the infantry moves forward.

331
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,458
What are you saying, exactly?

332
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,250
That's how they come.

333
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,708
[explosion sounds]

334
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,458
[shouting]

335
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,541
[heavy breathing]

336
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,291
Where are you going?

337
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,375
I'll come back.

338
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,125
It's nearly over.

339
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,041
- No! Let me go.
- Stay where you are.

340
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,625
- Let me out of here. I want to get out.
- Calm down.

341
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,083
Calm yourself.

342
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,583
No!

343
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,625
[screaming]

344
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,208
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

345
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Out!

346
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,250
[silence]

347
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,916
[sombre music playing]

348
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,625
[heavy breathing]

349
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,708
[muted gunshots and explosions sound]

350
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,791
[Franz muffled] Hey, that's Paul!

351
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,750
Albert!

352
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,666
Come here, we found Paul!

353
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,416
[Albert] Paul!

354
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,708
Are you alright?

355
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,333
Is everything alright, Paul?

356
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,583
[Franz] Come on. Paul, come on.

357
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,833
I'll help you.

358
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,458
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

359
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:23,625
[Albert] Are you injured?

360
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,541

for talking about something like that.

540
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,000
What about you, Paul?

541
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,666
- No idea. Can't think.
- [Tjaden] I'd stay with the Prussians.

542
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,528
[Albert] You're an idiot, Tjaden.

543
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,968
[Tjaden] Have you ever done
any peat digging?

544
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,125
Try it sometime.

545
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,528
[Albert] Can't be worse
than digging trenches in Champagne.

546
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,583
It takes longer
than digging trenches in Champagne.

547
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,265
And you can't get away with not doing it.

548
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,500
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

549
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,541
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

550
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,000
And then you have the softest bed.

551
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,875
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

552
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:27,958
And then...

553
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,083
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

554
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:35,166
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

555
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,083
A Cognac here, a pint there.

556
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:40,250
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

557
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,916
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

558
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,416
What's that?

559
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,666
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

560
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,416
You always make such useless comments.

561
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,180
What does it matter what you think anyway?

562
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,750
[engine sounds]

563
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,166
[shouting]

564
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,000
- Kat! Kat!
- Here!

565
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,125
- Kat!
- [Kat] Here!

566
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,208
[Tjaden] Kat!

567
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,458
[birds singing]

568
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,541
[airplane engine sounds]

569
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,500
[gunfire and explosions in distance]

570
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:17,458
"Darling one."

571
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,291
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

572
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,458
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

573
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,125
"A couple of pieces of cake."

574
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,000
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

575
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:32,958
"Some more..."

576
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,791
- Hing? Hingfong?
- Hingfong.

577
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,416
"...and a cup of sugar."

578
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,083
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

579
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:44,756
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

580
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,873
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

581
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,333
[laughs]

582
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:50,416
"My dear one."

583
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,875
"I must also ask a question of you."

584
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,375
"Have you started to save up any money?"

585
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,375
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

586
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,875
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

587
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,833
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

588
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,796
"You're probably thinking,
'What is she after?'"

589
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,541
"'How cheeky of her to ask.'"

590
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,333
"But I mean not to offend you."

591
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,708
"You know me, I can never get enough."

592
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,958
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

593
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,875
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

594
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:26,000
"Karl Lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the East."

595
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,660
"Something with his stomach."

596
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,458
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

597
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,500
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

598
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,750
"You've already played your role."

599
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,041
[laughs]

600
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:42,291
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

601
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,000
[both laugh]

602
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,083
"This Sunday, I'll visit the gra..."

603
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,291
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

604
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,791
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

605
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,375
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

606
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,888
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

607
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,833
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

608
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,541
"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."

609
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:23,833
[sniffs]

610
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I had no idea.

611
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,666
Oh, Paul.

612
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,375
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

613
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,666
Returning to a home,

614
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,916
having to go back to our normal being.

615
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:54,125
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

616
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:00,291
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

617
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,666
Sometimes I wonder...

618
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:06,708
Would...

619
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:10,166
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

620
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,000
Tjaden and Kropp.

621
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,083
And with Müller. He'd be sat with us.

622
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,333
And be eating fried potatoes.

623
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,125
Unpeeled.

624
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,125
Well...

625
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,000
[grunts, clears throat]

626
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:41,041
That's enough of that.

627
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:46,208
How long until we finally get going again?

628
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,833
[shouting] How long
until we finally get going again?

629
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:53,541
[horse snorts]

630
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,375
Franz?

631
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
[Franz] Yes?

632
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,250
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

633
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,875
To look for some children.

634
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,708
What happened?

635
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,833
[Paul] They should have arrived today.

636
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,375
A whole company.

637
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,250
How was it?

638
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,666
- Good.
- [Paul] Yeah?

639
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,416
Yes.

640
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:38,708
Here.

641
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:43,875
[sniffs]

642
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,958
Have a smell.

643
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:51,333
[laughs]

644
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,750
[Paul] What's her name?

645
00:50:58,833 --> 00:50:59,833
Eloise.

646
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,583
Eloise.

647
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:07,708
[Franz] She had skin as white as milk.

648
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,666
Breasts...

649
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,500
- [Albert] Hey.
- Huh?

650
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,363
[Albert] I want to smell it too.

651
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,208
Kropp, let me have it.

652
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,791
- Here.
- [Tjaden] Oh, my.

653
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:24,750
Give it to me.

654
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,708
[Tjaden] A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

655
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:30,083
- No.
- At worst, some sand from the seashore.

656
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,958
[Franz] Tjaden.

657
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,601
- Come on, pass it here.
- [Tjaden] I bet she bathes twice a day.

658
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:35,875
[laughing]

659
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,166
[Franz] Tjaden, give it back to me.

662
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,416
Sir.

663
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,875
Call the others.

664
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,333
There must have been a huge explosion.

665
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,875
[Kat] Mine thrower cannons.

666
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,666
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

667
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,683
Was he one of those we've come here for?

668
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,583
[Kat] No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

669
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,423
[Tjaden] He's been hanging there
for some time.

670
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,208
Not pleasant.

671
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,375
[Kat] Don't get soft now, men.

672
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,441
[Paul] How many are we looking for?

673
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,041
[Tjaden] Sixty young recruits.

674
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,958
Breakfast is turnip bread.

675
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,938
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

676
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,583
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

677
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,958
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

678
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:31,875
Gas.

679
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,083
There was gas here.

680
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,958

00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:56,666
[in French] Hello, madam.

684
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,291
I'm Kropp.

685
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:06,791
And you?

686
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,250
[laughs]

687
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,583
Mm.

688
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,083
Do you want to...

689
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,916
Do you want to come with me?

690
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,083
Not a problem.

00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,083
Kat.

696
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,750
Kat!

697
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,583
[in English] Shit.

700
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,666
- Flipping idiots.
- Uh huh.

701
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,208
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

702
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,166
Germany will soon be empty.

General.

710
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,333
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

711
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,041
The French are increasing the pressure.

712
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,833
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

713
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:33,250
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

714
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:36,083
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at Fernancourt.

715
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,875
Must mean an attack is likely.

716
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,416
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

717
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:45,958
General?

718
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:53,333
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

719
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:54,916
on the train to Compiègne.

720
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:05,500
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

721
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,583
My orders are war.

722
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:13,333
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

723
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,083
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

724
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,916
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

725
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,958
The French are trying everything they can

726
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:26,583
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

727
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,875
I will not capitulate.

728
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,666
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

729
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:40,458
[clicks heels]

730
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
General.

731
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,708
[train rumbles]

732
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,166
[urinating]

733
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,500
From our position,

734
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,791
I have to be clear...

735
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:12,333
We all have to be clear...

736
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:13,708
[train screeches]

737
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:14,875
For God's sake.

738
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,458
Shit.

739
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:20,000
[train screeches to a halt]

740
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,458
[sighs]

741
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:43,541
[horse neighing]

742
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:49,875
[soldier] Sir!

743
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,125
[lieutenant] Soldiers, pack your bags,

744
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,958
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

745
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:08,333
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

746
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,583
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

747
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,791
Line up, for God's sake.

748
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,583
You think the Frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

749
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:20,392
- Here we go again.
- [lieutenant] Get moving!

750
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:23,041
- Where to?
- Where to? Where to?

751
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,541
Into battle.

752
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
[ominous music playing]

753
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:39,041
- [cutlery rattles]
- [slurping]

754
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,541
[slurping]

755
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,333
[crockery rattles]

756
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,041
[interpreter clears throat]

757
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,666
Monsieur le Maréchal is awaiting you.

758
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,583
[ominous music continues]

759
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,208
[wind blowing]

760
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,208
[soldier vomits]

761
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,166
[inhales]

762
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,541
I'll come back for you.

763
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,166
Envious, huh?

764
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,958
[ominous music intensifies]

765
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:46,541
I stand before you

766
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:51,000
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

767
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,750
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

768
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,750
In the name of humanity,

769
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:00,541
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease-fire

770
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,708
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

771
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:07,166
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

772
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,083
[interpreter speaks French]

773
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:12,416
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

774
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,166
[interpreter speaks French]

775
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,293
[in French] Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

776
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,666
I don't know.

777
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,625
[in English] Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

778
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,666
We are here looking forward to hearing

779
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,250
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

780
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:42,458
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

781
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:43,875
[interpreter speaks French]

782
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:46,541
[Foch speaks French]

783
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,666
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

784
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:52,791
What does he mean by that?

785
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,791
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

786
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,333
Yes.

787
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:00,958
Good, then...

788
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:05,625
Monsieur Le Maréchal,

789
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:09,375
[in French] If you please,
we would like to know the conditions...

790
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,875
[Foch speaks French]

791
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,375
[speaks French]

792
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,500
[In English] He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

793
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,375
Monsieur le Maréchal,

794
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,708
I am asking you for an armistice.

795
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,041
[in French] We are asking
for an armistice.

796
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,791
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

797
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,059
[in English] You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

798
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,000
They are non-negotiable.

799
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,458
Seventy-two hours?

800
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:53,221
The war will continue until you sign them.

801
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,333
Monsieur le Maréchal,

802
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,125
in God's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

803
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,145
- Thousands of lives depend on it.
- [interpreter speaks French]

804
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:08,958
[in French] Sign then.

805
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:12,708
[ominous music playing]

806
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,791
[wind blowing]

807
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:25,916
Understood.

808
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
[ominous music intensifies]

809
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,583
- Soldiers, we'll march.
- Sir.

810
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:51,041
Soldiers, march.

811
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,333
March, soldiers.

812
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,416
Soldiers, march.

813
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,166
Off you go, get out of here.

814
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:02,291
March, soldiers.

815
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:04,916
March.

816
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:06,833
Soldiers, march.

817
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,958
March, soldiers. Off you go.

Open fire!

Get the hand grenades out!

853
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:31,916
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,333
Where is Franz?

884
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:51,666
I've left Franz alone!

[sergeant] Katczinsky!

886
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,750
Take the machine gun and retreat.

887
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:05,583
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast.

888
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,666
I miss my comrades, sir. I miss them all!

889
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,041
I miss my mother, for God's sake.

[sergeant] Get out of here! Let's go!

893
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,250
[major general] These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

894
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:52,666
[count] Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

895
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,708
And what expectations
do you have for that?

896
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,166
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

897
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,583
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

898
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,666
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

899
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,583
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

900
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,833
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

901
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:08,041
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

902
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:12,458
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

903
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:16,083
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

904
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,125
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

905
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,791
is false pride, as I see it.

906
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,235
Thanks to you and your commanders,

907
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,458
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

908
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

909
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,208
We are remaining here.

910
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:35,750
It is winter.

911
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,041
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

912
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,875
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

913
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:45,375
instead of dying
with hon our on the battlefield.

914
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,625
Honour?

915
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:52,291
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any hon our.

916
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,708
Von Helldorf.

917
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:03,125
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

918
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,375
and telegraph them to headquarters.

919
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,791
You inform the government.

920
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,333
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

921
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:14,750
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

922
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,291
there dies another soldier.

923
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,666
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

924
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,583
let's make peace.

925
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,434
- [explosions and gunfire]
- [screaming and shouting]

926
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:27,000
[grunting]

927
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,250
[in French] Retreat! Retreat!

928
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,333
[in English] Run! Run!

929
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,083
Keep firing!

930
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,125
[grunting]

931
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:19,000
[groaning]

932
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:20,125
Shut up!

933
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,375
[sombre music playing]

934
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,458
Shut up!

935
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:09,791
That's enough!

936
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:12,625
[crying]

937
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,875
[soldier spluttering]

938
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,541
[gasping]

939
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
[sobs]

940
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:05,416
[screams]

941
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,708
No, no, no.

942
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,333
Comrade.

943
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,208
Comrade, comrade.

944
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,625
[in French] So sorry.

945
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,041
So sorry.

946
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

947
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,291
DUVAL, GÉRARD
TYPOGRAPHER

948
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:15,916
Your wife...

949
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,000
Your wife...

950
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,291
I promise... I promise...

951
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,708
I promise...

952
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:45,666
[birds calling]

953
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:03,666
[birds calling]

954
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:08,875
[footsteps sound]

955
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:31,791
[orchestral music playing]

956
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:43,166
[footsteps sound]

957
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:54,541
[sighs]

958
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,791
[footsteps sound]

959
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,125
When were you born, Brixdorf?

960
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,291
1877, in June.

961
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:21,708
A summer child.

962
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:23,791
Yes.

963
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,083
What about your father?

964
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,625
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

965
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:35,541
[swallow, sighs] Producing what?

966
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:38,708
Riding saddles, general.

967
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,375
Riding saddles.

968
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:45,458
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

969
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,458
I am indeed fortunate.

970
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:51,833
And?

971
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:54,250
Are you looking forward to going home?

972
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,916
- When we are no longer needed here?
- Yes.

973
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,750
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

974
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,666
- I will take over the business.
- Mhm.

975
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:07,958
Congratulations.

976
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:09,583
And you?

977
01:31:11,916 --> 01:31:13,000
I'm a soldier.

978
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,083
My father was an officer in this regiment.

979
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,541
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

980
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,708
He won all three of them.

981
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:25,583
In 1871, he marched on Paris

982
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,083
and when he returned, he was a hero.

983
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:34,125
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

984
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:37,750
It's been 50 years of no war.

985
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,708
What is a soldier without war?

986
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,500
Were you and your father close?

987
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,458
[general] As a child, maybe.

988
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,875
A man is alone when born.

989
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,583
He lives alone

990
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:01,208
and on his deathbed is alone.

991
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,833
- [brush scratches]
- [heavy breathing]

992
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,291
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

993
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,000
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

994
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:38,500
- Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
- [Von Helldorf] Hindenburg.

995
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:39,875
[Erzberger] Open it immediately.

996
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:47,816
[Von Helldorf] He urges us to sign.

997
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:49,625
[exhales]

998
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:51,208
[distant shouting]

999
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:53,541
- [soldier 1] It's over!
- [soldier 2] We're going home!

1000
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:55,833
[screams] We're going home!

1001
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:58,083
[soldier 1] Back to our families.

1002
01:32:58,166 --> 01:33:00,166
[ominous music playing]

1003
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,375
[shouting and laughter]

1004
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:10,958
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

1005
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:14,666
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

1006
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:16,833
[cheering]

1007
01:33:16,916 --> 01:33:18,250
Knock on the monastery's door

1008
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:21,500
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

1009
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:24,375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

1010
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:28,625
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

1011
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:34,916
Are there any sergeants left?

1012
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:44,083
[screaming]

1013
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:46,250
[army doctor] Chloroform the man,
for God's sake.

1014
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,875
[agonized screams]

1015
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:01,541
[Tjaden] Bäumer.

1016
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,625
Bäumer.

1017
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:09,833
Bäumer.

1018
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:11,541
Tjaden? Tjaden.

1019
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:14,791
What happened?

1020
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,458
Where have you been hit?

1021
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:17,625
Above the knee.

1022
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,333
Or somewhere down there.

1023
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,791
I can't feel anything.

1024
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,291
How far up is the shot?

1025
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,666
I can't raise my head.

1026
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:30,125
Ten centimetres, it seems.

1027
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,115
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

1028
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:38,125
- You think so?
- [Paul] Yes, you are.

1029
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,166
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

1030
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:48,291
God damn shit.

1031
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,875
[Paul] You can still do it.

1032
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,166
Just wait and see.

1033
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,875
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

1034
01:34:58,291 --> 01:35:00,250
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

1035
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:02,041
[Paul] You won't have to.

1036
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:04,445
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

1037
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,250
Oh, dear Paul.

1038
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,416
I have something to give you.

1039
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:26,875
[sniffs]

1040
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,333
Is he dead?

1041
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,708
You must show braveness.

1042
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,625
You're alive, remember?

1043
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,541
For that, you have to be grateful.

1044
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,375
For us.

1045
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,750
- For those who didn't make it.
- That's enough.

1046
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,333
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

1047
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:11,416
[chattering]

1048
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,083
[soldier 1] Good feeling, right?

1049
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:23,375
Have a bit of that, then.

1050
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:25,666
[soldier 2] Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

1051
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:27,846
[soldier 1] The way the last summer was...

1052
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,583
[laughter]

1053
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,583
[soldier 1] Right, none...

1054
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:36,875
You see?

1055
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,398
- Not like the last one.
- [laughter]

1056
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,500
[soldier 1] That was too...

1057
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:44,708
[singing]

1058
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:46,583
[soldier 2] You always blame me.

1059
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:49,500
- [soldier 1] We saw you!
- [soldier 2] What did you see me doing?

1060
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:50,583
[all laugh]

1061
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:51,666
[soldier 1] Come on!

1062
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,166
Nah, we know it was you.

1063
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,875
[soldier 2] Why is it always on me?

1064
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:58,625
[shouting]

1065
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:00,708
[organ music playing]

1066
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,916
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

1067
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,583
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

1068
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,791
- We are that second company!
- [cheering]

1069
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,958
So dish it out! Give it to us!

1070
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,041
[Paul] Kat?

1071
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,916
- Kat!
- [Kat] Paul?

1072
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
[Paul] Kat!

1073
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,708
[Kat] Paul!

1074
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,833
- Paul!
- [Paul] Kat, you were alive.

1075
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:30,541
- [Kat] Paul!
- You're alive!

1076
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:31,625
[Kat] Paul.

1077
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:41,125
[Paul] Tjaden was hit.

1078
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:42,500
He's lying inside the church.

1079
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,666
He'll get a double portion from us.

1080
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:46,750
[Paul] Yes.

1081
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,791
Another one. In here.

1082
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,583
- [Paul] I thought you were dead.
- [Kat] Ha!

1083
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:00,916
At some point, we'll all die.

1084
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:03,358
[Paul] But not on the home stretch.

1085
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,333
[Kat] If you die before me, I'll kill you.

1086
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,583
- Ha!
- [Paul laughs]

1087
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:14,833
[Kat] Tjaden.

1088
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:17,791
Tjaden.

1089
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:22,916
Yes.

1090
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:24,750
- Kat?
- [Kat] Yes.

1091
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,833
- Kat.
- [laughs]

1092
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:32,416
I've soup here for you.

1093
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,916
[Tjaden] Have you brought cutlery?

1094
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,125
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

1095
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,916
There you go. Eat up.

1096
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:47,625
[slurping]

1097
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:06,000
[groaning]

1098
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,833
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

1099
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:11,333
Stop!

1100
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:16,625
We need help over here!

1101
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,291
What made you do that?

1102
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:20,375
Why would you?

1103
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,958
It's over for me.

1104
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,416
[Paul] He's bleeding out!

1105
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,375
Tjaden.

1106
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:36,416
Tjaden.

1107
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,000
[sombre music playing]

1108
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:21,541
[distant explosion sounds]

1109
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:11,875
[Kat] What is it?

1110
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:15,125
[Paul] I've lost something.

1111
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,375
Kat, do you speak French?

1112
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:24,291
[Kat] Mm.
<i>S'il vous plaît. S'il vous plaît.</i>

1113
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,666
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

1114
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,625
Aha.

1115
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:33,000
[glass bottle rolls]

1116
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:36,041
And the piano.

1117
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:40,083
She also warned me of war.

1118
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,708
She didn't want me to go.

1119
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:44,666
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

1120
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,708
I wanted to show that I could do it.

1121
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,125
[Kat] What use is that now?

1122
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,583
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

1123
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:02,375
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

1124
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:05,125
- [Kat] Paul.
- The stench will remain on us forever.

1125
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,184
- Enough.
- Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert...

1126
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,541
Is that to do with us?

1127
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,333
They don't suffer any more.

1128
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:12,833
Peace for them.

1129
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,458
We're still alive.

1130
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:20,000
[distant chatter]

1131
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,541
Everything here is like a fever.

1132
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:25,416
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

1133
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,791
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

1134
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:30,083
But nonetheless it happened

1135
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:32,226
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

1136
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,375
God looks down

1137
01:42:34,791 --> 01:42:36,083
at us murderers.

1138
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Yeah, well.

1139
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,125
[exhales]

1140
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,375
But what do I know?

1141
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:47,958
Nothing.

1142
01:42:48,666 --> 01:42:50,208
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

1143
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,416
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

1144
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:55,916
Yes.

1145
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:14,791
Kat?

1146
01:43:15,625 --> 01:43:16,708
[Kat] Mm.

1147
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,166
[Paul] What did your son die of?

1148
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:26,583
The pox.

1149
01:43:35,041 --> 01:43:36,708
I'm afraid of what's to come.

1150
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,083
Don't be.

1151
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:51,958
[ominous music playing]

1152
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:05,666
[ominous music intensifies]

1153
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,208
[in French] Henri.

1154
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,833
Taste it.

1155
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:27,916
Were they made today?

1156
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:32,875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

1157
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:34,875
Hmm.

1158
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:48,375
[drum beats sound]

1159
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:58,458
Monsieur le Maréchal.

1160
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm listening.

1161
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:09,041
[Erzberger, in English] The Kaiser
has abdicated.

1162
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:13,666
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

1163
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,250
The new government
will do everything it can

1164
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:18,875
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

1165
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:22,708
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

1166
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,750
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

1167
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:29,041
[in French] This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

1168
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:30,500
I don't fear it.

1169
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:32,208
I reject any compromise.

1170
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:33,875
[in English] I reject any compromise.

1171
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:36,041
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

1172
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:40,500
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

1173
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:41,583
[in French] Fair?

1174
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,458
You speak of fairness?

1175
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:01,750
Sign it.

1176
01:46:06,416 --> 01:46:07,416
[sighs]

1177
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:25,083
[pen scraping]

1178
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,690
[in English] Let the minutes record.

1179
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:09,208
[watch ticking]

1180
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:13,083
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

1181
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:16,916
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

1182
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:20,666
[Foch, in French] Very good.

1183
01:47:21,291 --> 01:47:22,416
The war is over.

1184
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,500
[cheering and gunfire]

1185
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:38,623
[Brixdorf, in English]
What are you going to do now?

1186
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:39,666
[watch ticking]

1187
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,000
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

1188
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,041
The plains of Latierre, general.

1189
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:47,125
Eguisac.

1190
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,250
I see them too.

1191
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:53,166
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

1192
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:57,333
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

1193
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,958
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

1194
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:01,361
who are selling the homeland off.

1195
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:07,458
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

1196
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,083
Have them all report here.

1197
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,291
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

1198
01:48:13,375 --> 01:48:15,375
[footsteps fade]

1199
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:17,458
[sombre music playing]

1200
01:48:24,083 --> 01:48:28,416
[voice on radio] <i>Any communication
with the enemy remains prohibited.</i>

1201
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:33,416
<i>Firstly, hostilities on the entire front
will be ceased this morning,</i>

1202
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,666
<i>November 11th at eleven o'clock.</i>

1203
01:48:36,416 --> 01:48:39,083
<i>Secondly, the troops
will not cross the line reached</i>

1204
01:48:39,166 --> 01:48:41,291
<i>on this day at this hour.</i>

1205
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:45,500
<i>The front line
shall remain unchanged past this hour.</i>

1206
01:48:45,583 --> 01:48:48,625
<i>All troops are to return to their station.</i>

1207
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,541
[Paul] What time is it?

1208
01:48:56,416 --> 01:48:58,416
- Why aren't you asleep?
- Listen a minute.

1209
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,125
It's so still.

1210
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:07,041
I must be going deaf.

1211
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:14,791
They've signed, Paul.

1212
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:20,583
The war's over.

1213
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:23,541
It's over.

1214
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:30,250
Are you hungry?

1215
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,375
I'm hungry.

1216
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:38,791
[Paul] Where are you going?

1217
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:41,000
[Kat] Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

1218
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:46,208
- What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
- [Paul] I don't know.

1219
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:48,041
[Kat] I'm gonna roast a goose.

1220
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:50,333
Red cabbage, potatoes...

1221
01:49:50,416 --> 01:49:53,041
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

1222
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:55,750
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

1223
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:56,875
[Paul] Yeah?

1224
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:59,250
- What does she look like?
- [Kat] Well...

1225
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:02,166
Long curly hair, dark.

1226
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:05,083
And she's buxom and strong.

1227
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:06,166
[Paul] Yeah?

1228
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:09,500
Christmas.

1229
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,625
It's all so far away still.

1230
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:13,916
[Kat] No, it's not. It's really close.

1231
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,583
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

1232
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:24,125
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

1233
01:50:24,208 --> 01:50:25,208
Ah?

1234
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:27,875
You know when...

1235
01:50:28,666 --> 01:50:30,416
Once we're back home, then we will...

1236
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,000
- Yeah?
- We must do something together.

1237
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,791
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

1238
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:36,875
Yeah, yeah.

1239
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:39,791
What is it?

1240
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,000
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

1241
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:47,083
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

1242
01:50:48,083 --> 01:50:49,363
Hasn't done me any good, though.

1243
01:50:50,541 --> 01:50:51,625
What are we gonna do?

1244
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,750
Sole shoes together?

1245
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,791
Are you trying to insult me?

1246
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:58,833
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

1247
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,528
You're going to university, Paul.

1248
01:51:02,541 --> 01:51:03,875
Or I'll shoot you right here.

1249
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,458
My trousers are loose.

1250
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,541
My trousers are loose.

1251
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:13,916
[laughs]

1252
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,875
[Paul] You'll just have to eat something.

1253
01:51:16,791 --> 01:51:19,072
[Kat] Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

1254
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:21,291
Whatever we want.

1255
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:28,791
[geese honking]

1256
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:47,416
It's your go.

1257
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:50,083
If the farmer catches me again,

1258
01:51:50,166 --> 01:51:52,041
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

1259
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:53,125
[clicks and whistles]

1260
01:51:56,458 --> 01:51:58,291
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

1261
01:51:58,375 --> 01:51:59,375
Yeah.

1262
01:52:31,291 --> 01:52:32,291
[woman] Ah?

1263
01:52:50,708 --> 01:52:52,791
Shh, shh... Hey, hey, hey.

1264
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:54,416
[barn door opens]

1265
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:14,208
[in French] Look.

1266
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,541
It's really good.

1267
01:53:21,916 --> 01:53:22,916
Want some?

1268
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,250
[in English] Shit.

1269
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
[calm piano music playing]

1270
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:06,333
- [dog barks]
- [shushing]

1271
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
[farmer, in French] Piece of garbage...

1272
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:18,208
Stop!

1273
01:54:19,166 --> 01:54:20,291
Thief!

1274
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,500
[in English] Kat! Run!

1275
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:32,375
Run!

1276
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,250
[in French] Asshole!

1277
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:41,958
God damn!

1278
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:45,041
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1279
01:55:02,291 --> 01:55:03,666
[in English] Oh, crap.

1280
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,166
- Look at this.
- What is it?

1281
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:08,083
- [Paul] A lucky shot.
- He hit the eggs!

1282
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:11,041
Stop the flow.

1283
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,791
Come on, get it in there.

1284
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:19,916
There you go.

1285
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,208
We can have an omelette.

1286
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:26,416
No, we'll eat them now.

1287
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,500
They're just as good.

1288
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:47,416
Better than ever.

1289
01:55:49,208 --> 01:55:50,208
I won't be long.

1290
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:22,083
[gunshot sounds]

1291
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,500
Kat?

1292
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:34,500
Kat?

1293
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:39,875
Kat!

1294
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,000
What happened?

1295
01:57:43,916 --> 01:57:44,916
We should leave.

1296
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:47,666
Who fired the shot?

1297
01:57:48,166 --> 01:57:49,541
That little shit from the farm.

1298
01:57:50,666 --> 01:57:51,833
The farmer's son.

1299
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:55,291
- [groaning]
- Kat, Kat.

1300
01:57:56,166 --> 01:57:57,208
[Kat] What a mess.

1301
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:06,333
How big is it?

1302
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:09,000
[Paul] Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1303
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:11,333
No. Give me a cigarette.

1304
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:13,708
Let the medic do that.

1305
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:34,208
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1306
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:37,750
I'd begun shaving already.

1307
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:40,541
Find me a word.

1308
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:44,208
That trifle can rhyme with.

1309
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:46,375
Mhm.

1310
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:50,583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1311
01:58:57,166 --> 01:58:58,541
Fucking shit.

1312
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:02,083
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1313
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:07,541
- Come on, we need to move.
- Yeah.

1314
01:59:07,625 --> 01:59:09,166
[grunting]

1315
01:59:10,083 --> 01:59:11,083
[drum beats sound]

1316
01:59:14,708 --> 01:59:15,708
[Paul] Alright?

1317
01:59:16,666 --> 01:59:17,875
Kat?

1318
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:19,083
- [drum beats sound]
- Rifle.

1319
01:59:19,166 --> 01:59:20,333
[Kat] Mhm?

1320
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:22,125
[Paul] Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1321
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:24,166
[laughs]

1322
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,375
[drum beats sound]

1323
01:59:29,708 --> 01:59:31,333
[drum beats sound]

1324
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:35,791
[Paul] When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1325
01:59:35,875 --> 01:59:37,708
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1326
01:59:38,416 --> 01:59:40,416
[distant cheering]

1327
01:59:52,291 --> 01:59:53,291
Hey!

1328
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:57,750
Wait!

1329
01:59:57,833 --> 01:59:58,833
[horn honks]

1330
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:00,333
Pull over!

1331
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:01,875
Let us on!

1332
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:04,541
Hey! Let us on!

1333
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:09,333
[grunting]

1334
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:16,750
Come on, will you?

1335
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,666
[heavy breathing]

1336
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:34,916
[drum beats sound]

1337
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:39,666
[drum beats sound]

1338
02:00:43,458 --> 02:00:44,791
[drum beats sound]

1339
02:00:47,416 --> 02:00:49,416
[chattering]

1340
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:53,375
This man needs care.

1341
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,916
Where is the medic?

1342
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
[grunting]

1343
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,760
[medic] Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

1344
02:01:28,875 --> 02:01:29,875
Huh?

1345
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:31,750
[medic] He's dead.

1346
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:39,541
But it's... It's just a small bullet wound.

1347
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:42,833
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1348
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,458
The organs are poisoned.

1349
02:01:51,416 --> 02:01:52,416
Unconscious.

1350
02:01:53,541 --> 02:01:54,541
[medic] No.

1351
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
He's dead.

1352
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,625
I know what I'm doing.

1353
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,791
Impossible. I was...
I was just talking to him.

1354
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:04,500
He's unconscious.

1355
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:07,458
He's unconscious.

1356
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:15,875
[medic] See?

1357
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:20,416
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1358
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:23,458
[medic walks away]

1359
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,791
[door closes]

1360
02:02:54,375 --> 02:02:56,375
[soldiers singing faintly]

1361
02:03:40,625 --> 02:03:42,625
[distant chattering]

1362
02:03:54,125 --> 02:03:56,125
[tense music plays]

1363
02:03:57,416 --> 02:03:59,416
[church bells ring]

1364
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:10,750
[sergeant] Go on, keep going!

1365
02:04:10,833 --> 02:04:12,208
Keep going!

1366
02:04:12,708 --> 02:04:14,333
Keep going, come on!

1367
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,083
[soldier] This is it.

1368
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:27,750
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1369
02:04:29,708 --> 02:04:30,708
It's over.

1370
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:34,208
[sergeant] Attention!

1371
02:04:40,416 --> 02:04:41,416
[general] Soldiers.

1372
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,166
We stand here as brothers

1373
02:04:45,125 --> 02:04:46,833
in a world of enemies

1374
02:04:46,916 --> 02:04:49,833
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1375
02:04:49,916 --> 02:04:52,875
render our beloved people defenseless

1376
02:04:54,166 --> 02:04:57,083
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1377
02:04:59,125 --> 02:05:00,125
Comrades.

1378
02:05:01,083 --> 02:05:02,916
Soon you will be going home

1379
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,416
to your parents, wives and children.

1380
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:07,541
The war is over.

1381
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:13,083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

1382
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:17,916
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1383
02:05:19,416 --> 02:05:21,000
Ah, but comrades,

1384
02:05:22,416 --> 02:05:25,250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

1385
02:05:27,291 --> 02:05:28,166
or as weaklings

1386
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:31,416
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

1387
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,580
[soldier] We're going home.

1388
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:33,625
[general] Soldiers.

1389
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:38,250
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

1390
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:42,500
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1391
02:05:42,583 --> 02:05:47,541
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

1392
02:05:47,625 --> 02:05:48,958
And make them see...

1393
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:49,916
[chattering]

1394
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,500
...we were victorious.

1395
02:05:51,583 --> 02:05:56,583
Onwards, with God on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

1396
02:05:56,666 --> 02:05:59,333
[soldier] I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

1397
02:05:59,416 --> 02:06:00,583
[Steinberger] Shut up!

1398
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:04,333
- [soldier] Let me go!
- [Steinberger] Follow your orders!

1399
02:06:04,416 --> 02:06:06,267
- [horse neighs]
- [Steinberger] Do as your told!

1400
02:06:06,291 --> 02:06:07,375
All of you, get back.

1401
02:06:08,083 --> 02:06:10,517
- [soldier] Please, I didn't do anything!
- [Steinberger] Aim!

1402
02:06:10,541 --> 02:06:13,291
- No! No!
- [Steinberger] Fire!

1403
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:14,458
[gunshots sound]

1404
02:06:20,083 --> 02:06:22,083
[chattering in French]

1405
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:38,791
[Steinberger] Keep moving!

1406
02:06:41,666 --> 02:06:42,666
Come on!

1407
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:52,666
Company, halt!

1408
02:06:56,958 --> 02:06:59,125
Rifle off!

1409
02:06:59,208 --> 02:07:02,375
- Fix bayonets!
- [soldier] Fix bayonets and load!

1410
02:07:13,041 --> 02:07:15,291
[watch ticking]

1411
02:07:17,416 --> 02:07:18,875
What time is it?

1412
02:07:18,958 --> 02:07:20,291
[soldier] Fifteen minutes to go.

1413
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,500
[chattering in French]

1414
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:59,025
[in French] It belonged to Lefèvre.

1415
02:08:00,291 --> 02:08:02,083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1416
02:08:02,791 --> 02:08:05,083
- He won't need it anymore.
- Thank you, sir.

1417
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:11,208
Here's to you and to Lefèvre.

1418
02:08:17,541 --> 02:08:18,583
Well, it's good.

1419
02:08:22,208 --> 02:08:23,208
The nightmare is over.

1420
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:26,791
[wind blowing]

1421
02:08:53,166 --> 02:08:54,791

02:09:16,416 --> 02:09:18,416
[distant rumbling and shouting]

1425
02:09:23,375 --> 02:09:26,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

1426
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:28,083
- In position!
- [soldier] In position!

1427
02:09:28,166 --> 02:09:30,583
[shouting]

1428
02:09:30,666 --> 02:09:32,083
Fire!

1429
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:34,166
Fire!
