1
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,333
<i>Ball one to Johnny Damon
and we are under way.</i>

2
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,402
<i>Damon has eight hits
in 18 at bats...</i>

3
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:42,073
<i>...a double, a triple,
a couple of stolen bases.</i>

4
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,368
<i>He had four hits
in the series opener.</i>

5
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:47,269
Strike.

6
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,855
<i>Down the right-field line,
fair off the bat of Damon.</i>

7
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,962
<i>It rolls by Spencer.</i>

8
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:08,258
<i>And Damon will coast into
second base with a leadoff double.</i>

9
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,040
<i>Into right-center field,
broken bat, it'll fall, a base hit.</i>

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,177
<i>They wave around Damon.
He will score.</i>

11
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,642
<i>And Jason Giambi delivers...</i>

12
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:24,748
<i>...with a run-scoring single
here in the opening inning.</i>

13
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,442
<i>And the Athletics
have taken that 1-nothing lead.</i>

14
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:29,553
Go, come on, now. We gotta spin it.

15
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,134
Let's go, Yankees!
Let's go, Yankees!

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,100
Let's go, Yankees!

17
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:48,295
<i>Bases loaded.</i>

18
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:52,637
<i>The Yankees have the tying run
at second, down 2-nothing.</i>

19
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,945
<i>The A's are kicking it and throwing it
all over the field.</i>

20
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:05,180
<i>And it might lead to their elimination
if they don't get it right in a hurry.</i>

21
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,020
<i>Hammered down the right-field line.
Justice!</i>

22
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,896
<i>The Yankees have taken the lead.</i>

23
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,499
<i>They're standing,
anticipating another trip...</i>

24
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:23,869
<i>...to the League
Championship Series.</i>

25
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:26,306
<i>The Yankees one out away.</i>

26
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,375
<i>Eric Byrnes, never with an at bat
in Yankee Stadium...</i>

27
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,213
<i>...and they don't get much bigger
than this one.</i>

28
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,948
<i>Or more hectic when you're up there
trying to get a job done.</i>

29
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,604
<i>And they're a strike away.</i>

30
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,409
<i>And they're roaring in the Bronx.</i>

31
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,658
<i>Losing the first two games at home
in the best-of-five series...</i>

32
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,828
<i>...and roar back to...</i>

33
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,174
<i>The Yankees will defend their title.</i>

34
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,502
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.

35
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,400
- I don't need to watch.
- Joe, leave it on.

36
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,596
Okay.

37
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,781
<i>Imagine how bad it'd be
if you were a Yankee player...</i>

38
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,285
<i>...and didn't like the taste
of champagne.</i>

39
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,021
<i>Better ask to get traded.</i>

40
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,593
<i>You gotta give the Yankees...</i>

41
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,388
<i>win the big game.</i>

42
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,364
<i>What a series that is gonna be
in the next...</i>

43
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,442
<i>You know how many kids
are wearing Giambi's...?</i>

44
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:43,206
<i>You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys
and hats and pictures and posters?</i>

45
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,851
<i>Those same kids will be booing
in July when the Yankees come here.</i>

46
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:51,250
<i>Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back
or the Pinstripes on the East Coast?</i>

47
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,948
<i>You can't blame them
for pilfering the henhouse.</i>

48
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,390
<i>- The henhouse is there.
- I can't blame them?</i>

49
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,860
<i>They're offering $ 120 million
over six years.</i>

50
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,694
<i>The Yankees have deeper pockets
and they're willing to give him money.</i>

51
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,461
<i>They're pilfering our players.</i>

52
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:09,038
<i>It's like we're a farm system
for the New York Yankees.</i>

53
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,315
- How are the guys doing?
- That was a killer.

54
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:20,451
That was a killer.
It's a tough one to swallow. It's...

55
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,213
- They played great.
- They played their hearts out.

56
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:26,619
They did. They played fantastic.
It just didn't fall our way.

57
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,727
- You'll do better next year.
- But we were close, though.

58
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,920
- We were so close.
- Right there.

59
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,497
Almost had it.
You gotta feel good about that.

60
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,897
I feel great about it.
I feel great about it.

61
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,939
We're not gonna do better next year.

62
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,011
- Why not?
- Well, you know we're being gutted.

63
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:53,151
We're losing Giambi,
Damon, Isringhausen.

64
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,912
Done deal. We're in trouble.

65
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:59,352
You'll find new guys.
You found Jason, you found Damon.

66
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:01,651
- I need more money, Steve.
- Billy.

67
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,988
- I need more money.
- We don't have any.

68
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:06,756
I can't compete against $ 120 million
with $38 million.

69
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,231
We're not gonna compete with
these teams that have big budgets.

70
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,064
We're gonna work
within the constraints we have...

71
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,003
...and you're gonna do the best job
that you can recruiting new players.

72
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,439
We're not gonna pay $ 17 million
to players.

73
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,806
I'm not asking you...

74
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,747
...for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.

75
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,713
I'm just asking for a bit of help.

76
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,548
Get me a little closer and I will get you
that championship team.

77
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:34,988
I mean, this is why I'm here.
This is why you hired me.

78
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,994
And I gotta ask you,
what are we doing here...

79
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,758
- Billy you know, I...
- If it's not to win a championship?

80
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:45,368
- I wanna win just as much...
- That's my bar. My bar is here.

81
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,439
My bar is to take this team
to the championship.

82
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:53,408
Billy, we're a small-market team,
and you're a small-market GM.

83
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:58,447
I'm asking you to be okay
not spending money that I don't have.

84
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,113
And I'm asking you
to take a deep breath...

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,812
...shake off the loss,
get back in a room with your guys...

86
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,516
...and figure out how to find
replacements for the guys we lost...

87
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,592
...with the money that we do have.

88
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:16,098
I'm not leaving here. I'm not...
I can't leave here with that.

89
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,300
What else can I help you with?

90
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,883
<i>It's a good offer,
and you gotta match it. L...</i>

91
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,712
I need another day.

92
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,151
<i>His mind's pretty made up.
I just think you should know that.</i>

93
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,118
- I got a call. I'll get you back.
- I'll let him know.

94
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,955
Bye.

95
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,894
- Yeah?
- Billy, Scott.

96
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,465
- Just got off the phone with Dan.
- You didn't.

97
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,192
<i>I was surprised he called me.</i>

98
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:54,497
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5
or he doesn't play anywhere else.

99
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:59,474
- That's the deal you made.
- Boston just upped it to 7. 75.

100
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,870
<i>You there?</i>

101
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:08,444
- We had a deal, Scott.
- We have a deal, if it's 8 million.

102
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,851
- Oh, man, you played me.
- I'm just doing my job for my client.

103
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,685
No, you're playing me,
and you're still playing me.

104
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,453
Congratulations, asshole. You win.

105
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,505
<i>I like guys that got a little hair
on their ass.</i>

106
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,470
<i>He looks like a Mantle or a Mays,
quite frankly.</i>

107
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,406
<i>- He's got a baseball body.
- Matty, who do you got?</i>

108
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,546
- I like Geronimo.
- Yes.

109
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,115
<i>The guy's an athlete.
Big, fast, talented.</i>

110
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,343
- Top of my list.
- Clean-cut, good face.

111
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,214
- Yeah, good jaw.
- Five-tools guy.

112
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,356
- Good-looking ballplayer.
- Can he hit?

113
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,651
- He's got a beautiful swing.
- The ball explodes off his bat.

114
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,955
He throws the club head at the ball,
and when he connects...

115
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,359
...he drives it, it pops off the bat.

116
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,831
- You can hear it all over the ballpark.
- A lot of pop.

117
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,062
If he's good,
why doesn't he hit good?

118
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,206
- He is a good hitter.
- He'll be ready.

119
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,070
He's gonna be a good hitter
against big-league arms?

120
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,040
- Could be great.
- I don't think so.

121
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,511
Kid needs at bats. Give him
400 at bats, he's gonna get better.

122
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,617
- He can play.
- He's hit everywhere along the line.

123
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,514
<i>He's one of our guys.</i>

124
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,351
<i>Okay, let's move on.</i>

125
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:27,965
- Artie, who do you like?
- I like Perez. He's got a classic swing.

126
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,603
- It's a real clean stroke.
- I don't know. Can't hit the curveball.

127
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,262
There's some work to be done,
I'll admit that, but he's noticeable.

128
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,738
- Got an ugly girlfriend.
- What's that mean?

129
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,968
<i>Ugly girlfriend
means no confidence.</i>

130
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,444
<i>You are full of it. Artie is right.
This guy's got an attitude.</i>

131
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,877
<i>An attitude is good.</i>

132
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,520
He walks in a room, his dick's already
been there for two minutes.

133
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,950
He passes the eye-candy test.
Got the looks.

134
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:54,057
He's ready to play the part.
He just needs playing time.

135
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,750
<i>I'm just saying,
his girlfriend is a six at best.</i>

136
00:09:56,962 --> 00:10:00,159
<i>Look, if we're trying to replace Giambi,
this guy could be it.</i>

137
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,992
<i>I agree with you.</i>

138
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,128
Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,070
Guys, you're just talking.

140
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:14,143
Talking... like this is business
as usual.

141
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,779
It's not.

142
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,378
We're trying to solve the problem.

143
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,075
Not like this.
You're not looking at the problem.

144
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,379
<i>We're very aware of the problem.
I mean...</i>

145
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,057
Okay, good. What's the problem?

146
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,029
Look, Billy,
we all understand what the problem is.

147
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,599
- We have to...
- Okay, good. What's the problem?

148
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,532
We have to replace three key players
in our lineup.

149
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,205
<i>Nope. What's the problem?</i>

150
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,931
<i>We gotta replace these guys
with what we have...</i>

151
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,804
<i>No. What's the problem, Barry?</i>

152
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:50,607
We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs
and 47 doubles to replace.

153
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,343
The problem we're trying to solve
is that there are rich teams...

154
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,353
...and there are poor teams,
then there's 50 feet of crap...

155
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,718
...and then there's us.

156
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,018
It's an unfair game.

157
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,001
<i>And now we've been gutted.
We're like organ donors for the rich.</i>

158
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,229
Boston's taken our kidneys,
Yankees have taken our heart.

159
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:15,770
And you guys sit around...

160
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:20,968
...talking the same old "good body"
nonsense like we're selling jeans.

161
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,375
Like we're looking for Fabio.

162
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,641
We got to think differently.

163
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,311
<i>We are the last dog at the bowl.</i>

164
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:32,490
You see what happens to the runt
of the litter? He dies.

165
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,255
Billy, that's a very touching story
and everything...

166
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:39,828
...but I think we're all very much aware
of what we're facing.

167
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,933
<i>You have a lot of experience
and wisdom in this room.</i>

168
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:47,231
You need to have a little faith and
let us do the job of replacing Giambi.

169
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,868
Is there another first baseman
like Giambi?

170
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,099
- No, not really.
- No.

171
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,108
- And if there was, could we afford him?
- Nope.

172
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,771
Then what the fuck
are you talking about, man?

173
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,577
If we try to play like the Yankees
in here...

174
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,588
...we will lose to the Yankees
out there.

175
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,726
Boy, that sounds like
fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.

176
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,422
- No, that's just logic.
- Who's Fabio?

177
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,293
He's a shortstop.
He's a shortstop from Seattle.

178
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,060
<i>Now, this is no time
to push the panic button.</i>

179
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,728
Our scouts will find players,
Player Development will develop them.

180
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,306
We'll teach them
to play Oakland A baseball.

181
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,410
<i>With all due respect,
we've been doing this a long time.</i>

182
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,912
Why don't you just let us
be responsible for replacing Giambi...

183
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,676
...with who we know that can play?

184
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,198
<i>- Easy power.
- And loose.</i>

185
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,893
<i>Good face.</i>

186
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,608
This son of a bitch
is going in the first round.

187
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,044
<i>You're a premium player, Billy.</i>

188
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:12,189
<i>You can run, you can field,
you can throw, you can hit...</i>

189
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,949
<i>...you can hit with power.</i>

190
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,990
<i>That doesn't come along very often.</i>

191
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,526
<i>This is Tom Martinez,
national cross-checker.</i>

192
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,130
<i>- How you doing? Nice to meet you.
- Billy Beane.</i>

193
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,463
It's been a while since I've seen
a five-tool guy that can do everything.

194
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,701
<i>I'm hopeful your interest
in professional baseball...</i>

195
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:33,037
<i>...is as strong as ours is gonna be
in getting you in this upcoming draft.</i>

196
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,744
<i>Mr. Beane?</i>

197
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,518
<i>Mark is ready to see you now.</i>

198
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,660
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

199
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:53,853
- How are you?
- Good.

200
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,632
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey, Mark.

201
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,634
- Good to see you. Please sit down.
- You too.

202
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,705
- These are the guys. Guys, Billy.
- Boys.

203
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,404
- How's it going?
- All right. How you been?

204
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:11,480
- You're filling out that chair nicely.
- I got three weeks in it right now.

205
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,672
Good, good, man.

206
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,352
- Yeah, man. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

207
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,112
- Awesome.
- Couldn't be better.

208
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,984
That's good to hear.
I'm not gonna waste your time.

209
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,285
You just tell me
what you're looking for.

210
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,758
Fifty million dollars
in additional payroll.

211
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:26,362
You should try Giambi.

212
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:30,699
I'm sorry. Too soon, right?
I want this to be a friendly meeting.

213
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:32,494
It's not all on your shoulders.

214
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,695
- Where's Steve in this?
- Steve's great.

215
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:36,931
He's supportive
in rebuilding this team.

216
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,609
That's what we're gonna do.

217
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,745
- So, what are you looking for?
- A left-handed reliever.

218
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,782
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.

219
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,074
That's not gonna happen.

220
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,382
Not even a discussion?

221
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,549
Billy, even if you could afford him,
respectfully, we love him.

222
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,695
We're not about to let him go.

223
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,863
You got this Venezuelan kid
coming up.

224
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,363
We had him.
We moved him to Detroit.

225
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,134
What else you thinking?

226
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,862
Outfielders.

227
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,735
- To replace Damon?
- Yeah.

228
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:15,572
- In your price range? No disrespect.
- Enough, Mark.

229
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,308
Hollins?

230
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,910
- García?
- No.

231
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,816
Maybe Coste.

232
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,317
That's it.

233
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:33,960
- All right, tell me about García.
- To replace Johnny Damon?

234
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,635
- Mark, is he healthy?
- Yeah, he's healthy-ish.

235
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,270
He had that back thing.

236
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,202
- He'll be ready for spring ball.
- I'll tell you what.

237
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,876
I can give you Guthrie
if you kick in some cash.

238
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,101
- Mark Guthrie?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,405
- How much cash?
- Two hundred K.

240
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,162
Okay.

241
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,000
- So García's gonna be a no.
- You're kidding me, right?

242
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,269
- You're kidding me.
- I'm not.

243
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:20,206
Okay. Straight up, García for Guthrie,
no kicker.

244
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,873
- No kicker?
- Straight up.

245
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,814
I think it's gonna be a hard no
on García, but let's just keep going.

246
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:35,220
- What else you thinking?
- What are we doing? Is this business?

247
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,657
This is the way we do business
in Cleveland.

248
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:22,871
Hey.

249
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,600
- Hello.
- Who are you?

250
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,415
I'm Peter Brand.

251
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,045
What do you do?

252
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,012
I'm special assistant
to Mark Shapiro.

253
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,054
So, what do you do?

254
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,896
Mostly player analysis right now.

255
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:49,794
Been on the job long?
First job in baseball?

256
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,635
It's my first job anywhere.

257
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,238
- Wow, congrats.
- Thank you.

258
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:59,035
First job. Whose nephew are you?

259
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,276
Why does Mark listen to you?

260
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,748
I don't think...

261
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,818
I don't think he does very often.

262
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,155
He just did.

263
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,751
Well, in that circumstance...

264
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,490
...I think he was more listening
to Bruce than myself.

265
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,493
Who are you?

266
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,433
I'm Peter Brand.

267
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:35,503
I don't give a rat's ass
what your name is.

268
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,374
What happened in there?

269
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,781
What happened in that room?

270
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,915
I'm not quite sure
what you're asking me, Mr. Beane.

271
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,523
What did you tell Bruce?

272
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:53,187
- I just told Bruce I like García.
- You like García. Why?

273
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,161
Why?

274
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:03,763
I don't know.

275
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,260
There is an epidemic failure
within the game...

276
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:27,022
...to understand
what is really happening.

277
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,669
And this leads people who run
Major League Baseball teams...

278
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,000
...to misjudge their players
and mismanage their teams.

279
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,579
I apologize.

280
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,537
Go on.

281
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:52,983
Okay. People who run ball clubs,
they think in terms of buying players.

282
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,153
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.
Your goal should be to buy wins.

283
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,696
And in order to buy wins,
you need to buy runs.

284
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,925
You're trying
to replace Johnny Damon.

285
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,028
<i>The Red Sox see Johnny Damon...</i>

286
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:09,866
<i>...and they see a star
who's worth $7.5 million a year.</i>

287
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,942
When I see Johnny Damon...

288
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:15,442
...what I see is...

289
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,282
...an imperfect understanding
of where runs come from.

290
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,577
<i>The guy's got a great glove.</i>

291
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:25,722
<i>He's a decent leadoff hitter.
He can steal bases.</i>

292
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,256
But is he worth the $ 7.5 million
a year...

293
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,587
...that the Boston Red Sox
are paying him?

294
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,626
No. No.

295
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,062
<i>Baseball thinking is medieval.</i>

296
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,734
<i>They are asking
all the wrong questions.</i>

297
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:42,066
And if I say it to anybody,
I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

298
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:47,210
So that's why I'm cagey
about this with you.

299
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,401
That's why...

300
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:52,515
I respect you, Mr. Beane,
and if you want full disclosure...

301
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:57,554
...I think it's a good thing
that you got Damon off your payroll.

302
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,250
I think it opens up all kinds
of interesting possibilities.

303
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,520
- Where you from, Pete?
- Maryland.

304
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,995
- Where'd you go to school?
- Yale. I went to Yale.

305
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,002
- What'd you study?
- Economics.

306
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,196
I studied economics.

307
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:24,112
Yale, economics and baseball.

308
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,912
You're funny, Pete.

309
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,036
<i>Tell me, why Billy?</i>

310
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,143
<i>What is it that makes him special?</i>

311
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:59,009
<i>Very rare do you come upon
a young man like Billy...</i>

312
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,311
...who can run, who can field,
who can throw, who can hit...

313
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,078
...and who can hit with power.

314
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,281
Those five tools,
you don't see that very often.

315
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Most of the youngsters
that we have an interest in...</i>

316
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,495
<i>...have one or two tools...</i>

317
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:15,291
...and we're hoping
to develop an extra one.

318
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,400
Your son has five.

319
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,595
We're looking at a guy that's a
potential superstar for us in New York.

320
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:23,637
<i>The time is now to get him started.</i>

321
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,640
We're prepared to make
a sizable financial commitment.

322
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,211
The Mets are gonna
stand behind Billy...

323
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,713
...because we expect him
to be our big-league center fielder.

324
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,976
This check here
represents the offer...

325
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:38,519
...that the New York Mets
would be making to Billy.

326
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:43,820
You do know that he's been accepted
to Stanford on a full scholarship?

327
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,154
I do.

328
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,763
So he can do both?

329
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:52,266
Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford
and professional baseball.

330
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,338
He would have to pick one
or the other.

331
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,009
<i>If he wants to be center fielder
for the Mets...</i>

332
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,041
<i>...wants to be a baseball player...</i>

333
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:06,115
<i>...he really needs to accept this
as life's first occupation, first career.</i>

334
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:10,014
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

335
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,689
We just don't know
when that's gonna be.

336
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:17,251
Some of us are told at 18, some of us
are told at 40, but we're all told.

337
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,126
<i>But this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.</i>

338
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:22,356
We want you badly...

339
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,866
...and we think that this amount
of money expresses that desire.

340
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,403
<i>Billy, this is your decision,
and whatever that decision is...</i>

341
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:32,075
<i>...you know it's fine
with your mother and I.</i>

342
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:45,217
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Billy Beane.

343
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,788
- Hey, what time is it?
- I don't know.

344
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:54,925
Listen, would you have drafted me
in the first round?

345
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,532
<i>What?</i>

346
00:23:56,734 --> 00:24:00,226
After I left,
you looked me up on your computer.

347
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,736
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

348
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,842
<i>I did, yeah.
You were a good player.</i>

349
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,239
Cut the crap, man.

350
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,347
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

351
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,180
<i>I'd have taken you in the ninth round.
No signing bonus.</i>

352
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:21,481
<i>I imagine you would've passed
and taken that scholarship.</i>

353
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:24,091
Yeah.

354
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,166
<i>Pack your bags, Pete.</i>

355
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,627
I just bought you
from the Cleveland Indians.

356
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:50,876
<i>- Is it attached to that clamp?
- Yeah, let me unhook it.</i>

357
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,855
<i>- Slide it up right there. To the left.
- I did.</i>

358
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,193
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Hang on, it's wet.</i>

359
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,960
<i>Come on.</i>

360
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,522
- Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on?
- Yes.

361
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,058
Great.

362
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,527
- Billy Beane's office.
- Hey.

363
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:34,755
- Peter Brand.
- Billy.

364
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,434
- How are...? Hi, how you doing?
- Nice to see you.

365
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,160
Good to have you here.
Boy, you move in fast.

366
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,204
Yeah, yeah.
I got here early this morning.

367
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,869
- All moved in.
- Yeah.

368
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,170
Yeah.

369
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,348
Hey, Billy...

370
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,416
...I wanted you
to see these player evaluations...

371
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,746
...that you asked me to do.

372
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,347
I asked you to do three.

373
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,622
Yeah.

374
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,351
- To evaluate three players.
- Yeah.

375
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,496
How many did you do?

376
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:08,631
Forty-seven.

377
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,057
Okay.

378
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,700
Actually, 51.
I don't know why I lied just then.

379
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,149
Why don't you walk me
through the board?

380
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,177
Thank you.

381
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,506
Using this equation
in the upper left...

382
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:01,776
...I'm projecting that we need to win
at least 99 games...

383
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:04,113
...in order to make it
to the postseason.

384
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:08,418
We need to score at least 814 runs
in order to win those games...

385
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,652
<i>...and allow no more than 645 runs.</i>

386
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,096
<i>What's this?</i>

387
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:21,863
<i>This is a code that I've written
for our year-to-year projections.</i>

388
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,668
<i>This is building in the intelligence
that we have to project players.</i>

389
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,866
<i>Okay.</i>

390
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,672
<i>It's about getting things down
to one number.</i>

391
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,706
<i>Using the stats
the way we read them...</i>

392
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,011
<i>...we'll find value in players
that nobody else can see.</i>

393
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,852
<i>People are overlooked...</i>

394
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:44,824
<i>...for a variety of biased reasons
and perceived flaws.</i>

395
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,294
<i>Age, appearance, personality.</i>

396
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:53,198
<i>Bill James and mathematics
cut straight through that.</i>

397
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,104
<i>Billy, of the 20,000 notable players
for us to consider...</i>

398
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,800
<i>...I believe
that there is a championship team...</i>

399
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,140
...of 25 people that we can afford...

400
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:07,476
<i>...because everyone else in baseball
undervalues them.</i>

401
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,916
Like an island of misfit toys.

402
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,590
<i>Billy, this is Chad Bradford.
He's a relief pitcher.</i>

403
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:23,028
<i>He is one of the most undervalued
players in baseball.</i>

404
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,169
<i>His defect is that he throws funny.</i>

405
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,065
<i>Nobody in the big leagues cares
about him because he looks funny.</i>

406
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:34,335
<i>This guy could be not just
the best pitcher in our pen...</i>

407
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:37,912
<i>...but one of the most effective
relief pitchers in all baseball.</i>

408
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:40,845
<i>This guy should cost $3 million
a year.</i>

409
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,885
<i>We can get him for 237,000.</i>

410
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,244
Billy.

411
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:13,181
- That it?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:44,678
Hey, Art.

413
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,043
Can I talk to you
before you get started?

414
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,651
- I'm a bit busy right now.
- I know.

415
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,113
- I know.
- Okay.

416
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,951
- Morning, everyone.
- Art.

417
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,390
- Peter Brand. Nice to meet you.
- Where the hell's Pete?

418
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,620
That's Pete.

419
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:03,032
Grab a seat. I'll be right back.

420
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,435
- All right, where did you say he's at?
- Okay. He's on...

421
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,800
- Who's the kid?
- A friend of mine.

422
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,511
I can't manage this team
under a one-year contract.

423
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,476
Well, sure you can.

424
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,309
No, I can't.

425
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,044
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.

426
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,691
After that, I'll take a good long look
at your contract.

427
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,157
Deal with the manager's contract,
then put a team on the field.

428
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,731
At this moment, if a grounder's hit
to first, nobody's there to stop it.

429
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,901
It's not easy doing what I do
under the cloud of a one-year contract.

430
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,470
Okay, I understand that.

431
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,607
- I've been there.
- I know you have.

432
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:49,212
A one-year contract means the same
thing to a manager as to a player.

433
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,574
There's not a lot of faith there.

434
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:54,512
Which is strange
after a 102-win season.

435
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,520
I see.

436
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:02,022
If you lose the last game
of the season, nobody gives a shit.

437
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,894
- So it's on me now?
- No, Art, it's on me.

438
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,398
And the kid is the new assistant GM.

439
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:13,593
- Okay.
- Okay, fellas.

440
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,396
Hey, Billy.

441
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:28,512
You can't deny his offensive output.
He can play.

442
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,688
And we need people that can play.

443
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,260
Who do you wanna talk about first?

444
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,049
None of them.

445
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,752
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 RBIs to make up for.

446
00:32:02,953 --> 00:32:05,285
Guys, you're still trying
to replace Giambi.

447
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:08,947
I told you we can't do it,
and we can't do it.

448
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,724
Now, what we might be able to do
is re-create him.

449
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,900
- Re-create him in the aggregate.
- The what?

450
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,831
Giambi's on-base percentage
was .477.

451
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:24,440
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.

452
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,837
Add that up and you get...

453
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:30,775
Do you want me to speak?

454
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,680
When I point at you, yeah.

455
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,785
- 1.092.
- Divided by three.

456
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:39,717
- .364.
- That's what we're looking for.

457
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:44,020
Three ballplayers... Three ballplayers
whose average OBP is...

458
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,525
.364.

459
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:48,562
- Wait, that doesn't come out right.
- It's right, Artie.

460
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,994
- Billy.
- You gotta carry the one.

461
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,568
- Billy.
- Scratch this out.

462
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,569
- Yeah?
- Who's that?

463
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,366
That's Pete.

464
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,041
- Does Pete really need to be here?
- Yes, he does.

465
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,014
Okay, here's who we want.

466
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,449
Number one:
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.

467
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:13,487
- Oh, God.
- Billy, that's trouble.

468
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,420
Billy, look, if I... Yeah.

469
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,561
Billy, if I may,
he has had his problems off the field...

470
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,060
...and we know what he can't do
on the field.

471
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,130
He's getting thick around the waist.

472
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,962
There's reports about him on weed,
in strip clubs.

473
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,798
His on-base percentage
is all we're looking at now.

474
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:34,376
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot
for a guy who only costs 285,000.

475
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:37,547
- Jeez, Billy...
- Number two:

476
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:41,047
- David Justice.
- Oh, no.

477
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,117
- His legs are gone.
- Not a good idea.

478
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,878
- Old Man Justice?
- Why is that?

479
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,216
Steinbrenner's so pissed
at his decline...

480
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:50,188
...he's willing to eat his contract
to get rid of him.

481
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:53,090
- Exactly.
- Ten years ago, Justice, big name.

482
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,286
Been in big games.

483
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:57,695
He's gonna really help
our season tickets early in the year...

484
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:02,498
...but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

485
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:06,335
Billy, his legs are gone,
and he's a defensive liability.

486
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,671
I question
whether the bat speed's there.

487
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,210
- His legs are gone.
- Grady.

488
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:14,373
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?

489
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,748
Because he gets on base.

490
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,351
- What is this?
- What are we doing?

491
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,583
Okay, number three:

492
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,364
- Scott Hatteberg.
- Who?

493
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,592
- Hatteberg?
- Exactly.

494
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:33,633
He sounds like an Oakland A
already.

495
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:37,796
- Yes, he's had a little problem with...
- Little problem? He can't throw.

496
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:41,637
He's a career .260 hitter.
The best part of his career is over.

497
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:44,575
- It's just getting started.
- Boston wants to cut him.

498
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,273
- No one wants to pick him up.
- Good. He's cheap.

499
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:50,112
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy...

500
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,620
...that's been released
by half the organizations in baseball...

501
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,954
...because he's got nonrepairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.

502
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,495
He can't throw and he can't field.
But what can he do?

503
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,688
Oh, boy.

504
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,266
Check your reports
or I'm gonna point at Pete.

505
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,937
- He gets on base.
- He can get on base.

506
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:10,698
- So he walks a lot.
- He gets on base a lot, Rocco.

507
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,502
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?

508
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,042
Pete?

509
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:17,440
- You do not.
- I do not.

510
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,674
I got 37 free agents
that are better than those three guys.

511
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:23,079
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

512
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,915
So you're not gonna bring in one...

513
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:29,422
...but three defective players
to replace Giambi?

514
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,628
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?

515
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,764
This is the new direction of the A's.

516
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:37,832
We are card counters
at the blackjack table...

517
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,731
...and we're gonna turn the odds
on the casino.

518
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,801
- I don't see it.
- Seriously, guys.

519
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,670
I think we have to remember
this is the man.

520
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:52,281
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.

521
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,316
And he doesn't have to answer
to us.

522
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,919
We make suggestions,
he makes decisions.

523
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,489
That's all fine and well, but we've been
working our asses off...

524
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,492
...for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.

525
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,164
This is not a discussion.

526
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:13,899
- What are we discussing?
- Barry, not a discussion.

527
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:21,537
Billy, man...

528
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,472
...there's one thing you're forgetting.

529
00:36:25,115 --> 00:36:29,814
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.

530
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,318
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.

531
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,888
Teach?

532
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,720
Which one?

533
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:52,173
This is really the kickoff to the holiday
season here in downtown Seattle.

534
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,809
It took weeks of planning...

535
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,946
...to lead up to the big event,
but it was well worth it.

536
00:36:57,147 --> 00:37:00,548
The weather was ideal.
People are still having a great time.

537
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,616
Thousands of people
were out earlier.

538
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,412
We have a nice recap for you...

539
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:08,580
...of all the great events taking place
downtown in Seattle...

540
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,754
- Hello?
- Scott?

541
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:14,953
Yes.

542
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:18,134
- It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A's.
- Yes.

543
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:21,168
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

544
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:23,271
<i>Do you wanna let us in?</i>

545
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,833
- Pardon me?
- We're out front.

546
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,439
- What?
- On the curb.

547
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,410
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

548
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:35,408
<i>Honey?</i>

549
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:41,791
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

550
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:43,653
Very kind.

551
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:48,994
<i>How's the elbow, Scott?</i>

552
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,498
You know, it's good.
It's really good. It's great.

553
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,135
- I can't throw the ball at all.
- Yeah.

554
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,041
<i>You've thrown your last ball
from behind home plate.</i>

555
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,409
- That's what I'd say.
- Well...

556
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,416
Good news is, we want you at first.

557
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:21,253
<i>We want you to play first base
for the Oakland A's.</i>

558
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,627
Okay, well...

559
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,564
...I've only ever played catcher.

560
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,204
Scott, you're not a catcher anymore.

561
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,708
If you were, our call wouldn't
have been the only one you got.

562
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,775
- Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

563
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:43,681
- But the thing is, is...
- You don't know how to play first base.

564
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:45,379
- Scott.
- That's right.

565
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,447
It's not that hard, Scott.

566
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,819
- Tell him, Wash.
- It's incredibly hard.

567
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,155
Hey, anything worth doing is.
And we're gonna teach you.

568
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:55,661
Wait a minute here.
I mean, but what about...?

569
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,959
Jason's gone, Scott.

570
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:00,959
You want me to take Giambi's spot
at first base?

571
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,570
- Yeah.
- What about the fans?

572
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,072
- Maybe I can teach one of them.
- The fans don't... Good one.

573
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:09,973
- Fans don't run my ball club.
- Honey, what are you doing awake?

574
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:12,738
Sweetheart, can you...?

575
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:15,680
That's my daughter.

576
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,020
You got kids?

577
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,817
Yeah, a daughter.

578
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:26,428
Scott, this is a contract to play ball
for the Oakland A's.

579
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,655
A copy's been sent over
to your agent.

580
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,699
Discuss with your wife, let us know.

581
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:33,963
Thank you.

582
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,399
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

583
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,574
- Oh, and, Scott.
- Yeah?

584
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:40,072
Don't tell anyone
about the first-base thing.

585
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,266
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

586
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,912
- Happy holidays.
- All right.

587
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,801
- Hey, Sharon.
- Hi, Billy.

588
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,205
- Is she ready?
- She's out with friends.

589
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,404
But she'll be back. Come in.

590
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,479
- Okay.
- Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

591
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,981
Here you go.

592
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,716
- Here, wanna have a seat?
- Yeah.

593
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,630
- You good, Billy?
- Yeah. How are you, Alan?

594
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:42,202
Good. Really good.
Things are peaceful around here.

595
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,299
It's good to see you.

596
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,444
Thanks, Alan.

597
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:50,738
I haven't got to see you
since play-offs.

598
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,416
I wanted to say
that New York was heartbreaking.

599
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,449
I'm sure for you too.

600
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:59,588
Not many teams make it that far,
and to watch you go that far was...

601
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:05,251
- It was really an accomplishment.
- Well, that's nice.

602
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:08,324
How is the team shaping up?

603
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,263
- Team's good. Rebuilding.
- Good.

604
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:15,495
I read you lost Giambonni
and Damon.

605
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:16,695
- Giambi.
- Giambi.

606
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,501
- Yeah.
- Damon, Isringhausen.

607
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,669
- They're really...? They're gone?
- Gone. Yesterday's news.

608
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,247
- That's terrible.
- No, but that is a tough situation.

609
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,043
That's...

610
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:32,585
You're gonna be fine, though.
You always figure something out.

611
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,691
Where is she? Where was she?
Down the street or...?

612
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:43,855
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her
on her cell. She's coming up the hill.

613
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:45,329
Okay.

614
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:47,730
She's got a cell phone?

615
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:50,798
- Yeah.
- A 12-year-old?

616
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,475
Yeah.

617
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,572
For emergencies.

618
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,709
Big parenting decision.

619
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:05,347
But it's something that, you know,
we, you know, all should discuss...

620
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:08,991
...because if you have any objections,
of course...

621
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:11,626
Her mother and I will discuss it.

622
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,190
But thank you.

623
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,031
Any of these?

624
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,170
I don't know.

625
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,362
- Do you...?
- This one's cool.

626
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:27,168
<i>- Is that good or bad? Butterflies.
- They're okay.</i>

627
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:32,076
- Look, that one's pretty. I like the red.
- Should we try?

628
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,111
No?

629
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:35,875
- Oh, I like this one.
- Yeah?

630
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,451
Dad, look at this one.

631
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:39,884
- Look how it's red.
- It's beautiful.

632
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,422
- This one's pretty.
- Let's try it out.

633
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,992
- Just right here?
- Why don't we go over there?

634
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,685
Can we go over there?

635
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,309
Oh, honey, you need to sing.
That's so good.

636
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,146
That's beautiful.

637
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:14,712
Sometimes I sing.

638
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:20,557
It's fun to sing with your song,
but I don't want people to listen to me.

639
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,598
Well, honey, I think people would love
to listen to you. That's beautiful.

640
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:28,696
Would you sing a little for your dad?

641
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,998
Right here
in the middle of the store?

642
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,243
- Little bit.
- Little bit.

643
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,709
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

644
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,110
Okay.

645
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,816
<i>Billy Beane was taken
in the first round of the amateur draft.</i>

646
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:21,252
<i>I think this is a steal,
to get Billy Beane.</i>

647
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,948
<i>He's young, he's talented.</i>

648
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,460
<i>A true five-tool player with speed.
This guy is a can't-miss prospect.</i>

649
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:29,859
<i>This is a great sign
for the New York Mets.</i>

650
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:33,502
<i>And it could be the turnaround
that they've been looking for.</i>

651
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,403
<i>Ball one.</i>

652
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:38,096
<i>I'll take Billy Beane
over Strawberry.</i>

653
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,675
<i>Billy Beane, an interesting pick,
turned down a scholarship.</i>

654
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:43,368
<i>He could've gone to Stanford.</i>

655
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,879
<i>Sometimes you don't find out
till you get to the big leagues...</i>

656
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:51,680
<i>This guy has never failed at anything.
He's coming out of high school.</i>

657
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:55,483
<i>Billy was gonna go to college.
He could've been a great quarterback.</i>

658
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,197
<i>Strike three.</i>

659
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:09,034
<i>There's not an organization
in baseball...</i>

660
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,871
<i>...who would not have taken a chance
on this young guy.</i>

661
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:19,012
<i>He didn't pan out.
That happens every year.</i>

662
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,315
<i>Some do, some don't.</i>

663
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,522
<i>I mean, if you're having any doubt
at all about this...</i>

664
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:31,459
<i>Having the scholarship...</i>

665
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:34,687
<i>Your son was born
with a God-given ability.</i>

666
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:39,061
<i>Few scouts can go into the mind
of a young man...</i>

667
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,466
<i>...and determine
whether he's really confident...</i>

668
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:43,900
<i>...about what he can do.</i>

669
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:45,802
<i>A very special player.</i>

670
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,569
<i>So you can sign him
based on his ability...</i>

671
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:52,305
<i>...but then he's gotta be successful
to be confident.</i>

672
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:57,111
<i>And once he becomes confident,
that's when you've got something.</i>

673
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,821
<i>You make a decision
on what you see.</i>

674
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,519
<i>And if things don't pan out,
you move on.</i>

675
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,722
<i>That's baseball.</i>

676
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,924
<i>Many are called, few are chosen.</i>

677
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:18,570
<i>Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis.
That is the Greek God of Walks.</i>

678
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,072
<i>That's my hero.</i>

679
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,246
That man gets walked
more than anybody in baseball...

680
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:25,346
...except for Barry Bonds.

681
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:29,006
I tried to convince Shapiro
to pick him up last June...

682
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,551
...but he said he waddled
like a duck.

683
00:46:32,088 --> 00:46:34,249
Yeah, Boston snagged him.

684
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:36,322
I think they wanna wait and see.

685
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,496
- Are you okay, Billy?
- Billy?

686
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,301
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

687
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:04,481
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?

688
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,724
- May I speak candidly?
- Sure, go ahead.

689
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:16,763
Major League Baseball and its fans,
they're gonna be more than happy...

690
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:19,366
...to throw you and Google Boy
under the bus...

691
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:21,537
...if you keep doing
what you're doing.

692
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,104
You don't put a team together
with a computer.

693
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:26,002
- No?
- No.

694
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:28,871
Baseball isn't just numbers.
It's not science.

695
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,242
If it was, anybody could do
what we're doing, but they can't.

696
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,144
They don't know what we know.

697
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,411
They don't have our experience
and our intuition.

698
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,012
Okay.

699
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:43,092
You got a kid in there that's got
a degree in economics from Yale.

700
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,387
You got a scout here
with 29 years of baseball experience.

701
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:49,156
You're listening to the wrong one.

702
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,166
Now, there are intangibles
that only baseball people understand.

703
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,601
You're discounting
what scouts have done for 150 years?

704
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:58,797
Even yourself?

705
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,636
Adapt or die.

706
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,779
This is about you and your shit,
isn't it?

707
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:09,918
Twenty years ago,
some scout got it wrong.

708
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,680
- Okay. Okay.
- Now you declare war on the system.

709
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:17,553
Okay, okay, my turn.
You don't have a crystal ball.

710
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:21,322
You can't look at a kid and predict
his future any more than I can.

711
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,761
I've sat at those kitchen tables
with you...

712
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,959
...and listened to you tell parents,
"When I know, I know.

713
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,138
And when it comes to your son,
I know."

714
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,739
And you don't.

715
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:35,139
You don't.

716
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,080
Okay. I don't give a shit
about friendship...

717
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:42,808
...this situation, or the past.

718
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:46,580
Major League Baseball thinks
the way I think. You're not gonna win.

719
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,350
And I'll give you a nickel's worth
of free advice.

720
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,823
You're never gonna
get another job...

721
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:55,555
...after this catastrophic season
you're about to set us all up for.

722
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:57,733
You'll have to explain to your kid...

723
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,425
...why you're working
at Dick's Sporting Goods.

724
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,676
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

725
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,643
- Fuck you, Billy.
- Now I will.

726
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:21,422
Good luck, Art.

727
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,590
Kubota.
You never played ball, right?

728
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,598
- I played a little T-ball.
- You're the new head scout.

729
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,464
Congratulations.

730
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,245
So Boston's gonna wait and see?

731
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,215
Yeah.

732
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:53,021
- Yeah.
- It's just you and me, Pete.

733
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,952
And we're all in.

734
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:01,763
<i>It sounds like you're apologizing
for what they're doing.</i>

735
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,627
<i>I'm not. I just don't know
what you're gonna do...</i>

736
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:08,167
<i>...with the budget that the A's have.
Who are you gonna get?</i>

737
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:10,498
<i>I'm looking
at the spring-training roster.</i>

738
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,402
<i>- You gotta be kidding me.
- How so?</i>

739
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,668
<i>- He looked like a clown out there.
- Who?</i>

740
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,445
<i>- Chad Bradford.
- Tell me about Bradford.</i>

741
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,048
<i>I like him a little bit,
but he's a specialist.</i>

742
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,277
<i>He's not a guy that you say,
"The eighth inning is yours...</i>

743
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:26,284
<i>...lefties vs. Righties."</i>

744
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,116
<i>In my opinion.</i>

745
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,724
<i>I don't know what Billy Beane
and management...</i>

746
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,224
<i>...understands about him.</i>

747
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:35,056
<i>He only throws the ball
about 82, 83 miles an hour.</i>

748
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,666
<i>- There must be something...
- He is a freak, and not in a good way.</i>

749
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:43,266
<i>- Let me ask you this.
- Talking about trying to win a division.</i>

750
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,771
<i>We're counting on David
to be the guy he was.</i>

751
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:48,443
<i>I have my doubts. He's gotten old.</i>

752
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,081
<i>That's why he's not in New York
anymore, not in Cleveland anymore.</i>

753
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,615
<i>We paid him the money we should've
been giving to Johnny Damon.</i>

754
00:50:55,818 --> 00:50:56,842
<i>- Hey.
- Jeremy Giambi.</i>

755
00:50:58,254 --> 00:50:59,812
<i>That's the one to worry about.</i>

756
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,753
<i>He gets comps up and down Vegas
more than in Oakland.</i>

757
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,291
<i>That should tell you something
right there.</i>

758
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:09,022
<i>- Isn't that the deal with these guys?
- He has one good year.</i>

759
00:51:09,432 --> 00:51:12,868
<i>And he gets a huge offer
and then he gets traded.</i>

760
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:18,365
- Bob. Harder.
- Hatteberg.

761
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,708
<i>Good. Good.</i>

762
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,775
<i>Billy, we have to talk
about Hatteberg.</i>

763
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,418
<i>- Go.
- There's just no feel for the spot.</i>

764
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,112
<i>I think it's a long shot that he can be
a big-league first baseman.</i>

765
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,589
It's day one of the first week.
You can't judge this yet.

766
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,352
No, I think we can judge it.

767
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:43,794
I mean, I like him, you know,
but I can judge him.

768
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,592
First base is the moon to him.

769
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,636
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the worst
first baseman in baseball.

770
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,297
- Gonna compare him to Giambi?
- What are we talking about?

771
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:54,771
All right.

772
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,075
What do you think, Wash?

773
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:02,084
The nice way to say it
is he lacks confidence.

774
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,752
Well, give him some.

775
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:07,047
I'll do that, but we got Peña,
who can play first.

776
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:09,622
And he's looking mighty good
out there.

777
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,519
We wanna go with Hattie.

778
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,091
We got six weeks.

779
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,167
Get down in it.

780
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:28,640
- There you go.
- Scotty H.

781
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,473
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Picking machine.

782
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,979
It's only baseball.

783
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,214
This better work.

784
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,459
I'm just kidding you.

785
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:01,775
Let's go, Oakland!

786
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,242
Let's go, Oakland!

787
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:10,049
- What is wrong with this thing?
- It's a dollar, man.

788
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,653
- What?
- Welcome to Oakland, D.J.

789
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:14,846
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

790
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:18,858
I think this year, we're gonna show
that it takes a team to win...

791
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,189
...not any individual guy,
just a team.

792
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:24,764
And I think we got
a hell of a ball club here.

793
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:26,958
Chad, are you intimidated
at all today?

794
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:32,335
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really.
I'm just really excited, like you said.

795
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,000
Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare
without your brother, Jason?

796
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,874
Well, you know,
the organization did a great job...

797
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,744
...of bringing in good young guys
to fill that role.

798
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:44,351
Let's face it,
they're getting a deal with you.

799
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,784
The Yankees are paying Jason a lot
of money.

800
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:50,015
You are coming here on a dime.
How does that make you feel?

801
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,126
I feel good.

802
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:55,263
- How are the nerves in your fingers?
- You know.

803
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,490
Gotta start with the age,
36 years old.

804
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,895
How do you think
your body's gonna hold up?

805
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:03,266
You spend a lot of time at strip clubs,
partying.

806
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,033
Do you resent the attention you get
off the field?

807
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,231
I love it.

808
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:09,604
- You spend a lot of time in Vegas.
- I do.

809
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:14,010
- I feel great. I did a lot of work to get...
- Excuse me. Get out of my shot.

810
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,206
Sorry, go ahead.

811
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,511
There have been questions
about my age...

812
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,417
...and my declining skills, some say,
but I'm here to prove that wrong.

813
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:23,285
I asked if you were 100 percent.

814
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,132
- Excuse me, Mr. Beane?
- Hey, Chad.

815
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,602
- Hey, I'm not disturbing you, am I?
- Not at all. What's up?

816
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,867
I wanted to say thank you
for this opportunity.

817
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:44,513
Well, we enjoy having you.
It's gonna work out well for all of us.

818
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,582
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever
given me a chance like this before.

819
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:50,242
Nobody?

820
00:54:51,387 --> 00:54:53,412
Well, just you, sir.

821
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:57,356
Well, it's a big day,
one you won't forget.

822
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,687
Appreciate it.
And I wanna let you know...

823
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,694
...I'm gonna be praying for you
and your family.

824
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,995
No problem.

825
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:09,229
Well, here we are just minutes away
from the season opener of 2002...

826
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:10,598
...for the Oakland A's.

827
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,468
The first pitch is moments away.

828
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:14,768
We'll come back
with the national anthem.

829
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,342
<i>Opening day is upon us.</i>

830
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,371
All right, fellas, smile. Here we go.

831
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:30,692
I'm going in.
Text me the play-by-play.

832
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:32,451
What? Why?

833
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:35,329
I don't watch the games.

834
00:55:43,906 --> 00:55:45,464
<i>Detail, halt!</i>

835
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,709
<i>And forward face!</i>

836
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:52,967
<i>That's the third Ranger batter
to be hit today.</i>

837
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:57,635
<i>Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked.
The ninth...</i>

838
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:35,477
I should've made you a bigger part
of the conversation from day one.

839
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,653
It'd be clear what we're trying to do.

840
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:40,788
That was my mistake, Art.
I take responsibility for that.

841
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,357
- What are you trying to say?
- Doesn't matter what moves I make...

842
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,529
...if you don't play the team
the way they're designed to be.

843
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,629
Billy, you're out of your depth.

844
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:55,827
- Why not Hatteberg at first?
- Because he can't play first.

845
00:57:56,038 --> 00:57:58,438
- How do you know?
- Not my first baseball game.

846
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,303
- Scott Hatteberg can't hit.
- He gets on base.

847
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,877
Still keeps us in the plus column.
We need to be seven over .500.

848
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,605
What?

849
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:12,145
Anything else?

850
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:16,587
Yeah. I would've rather seen
Bradford in the end than Magnante.

851
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:18,250
Bradford's a righty.

852
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,521
- I don't care about righty-lefty.
- I do.

853
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,296
- Could this be about your contract?
- No.

854
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:33,838
This is about you doing your job
and me doing mine.

855
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,533
Mine's me being left alone...

856
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,646
...to manage this team
you assembled for me.

857
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,375
- I didn't assemble them for you, Art.
- No shit.

858
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:52,259
Good meeting.

859
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:53,519
Every time we talk...

860
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:56,493
...I'm reinvigorated
by my love of the game.

861
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:23,290
<i>We got Grady Fuson, former head
of scouting with the Athletics.</i>

862
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:26,222
<i>And, Grady, can you interpret for us
what's going on?</i>

863
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,556
<i>- They call it Moneyball.
- Moneyball?</i>

864
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:33,258
<i>Yes, and it was a nice theory,
and now it's just not working out.</i>

865
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:37,462
<i>Billy Beane has built this team
on the ideas of a guy, Bill James...</i>

866
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:42,269
<i>...who wrote an interesting book
on baseball statistics.</i>

867
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:46,437
<i>The problem is that Bill James
never played, never managed.</i>

868
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,982
<i>He was in fact a security guard
at a pork-and-beans company.</i>

869
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:54,049
<i>Do you see this as a decimation
of the organization?</i>

870
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:56,724
<i>- I think he bought a ticket on the Titanic.
- Oh, boy.</i>

871
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,121
<i>He's tried to come up
with a new approach.</i>

872
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:02,559
<i>My hat's off to him. It won't work.</i>

873
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:06,357
<i>One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.</i>

874
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:07,695
<i>And that is the game.</i>

875
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:10,929
<i>The Seattle Mariners
win both games on this series, Ray.</i>

876
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,667
<i>They've won 10 in a row.
Seattle is 13 and 3.</i>

877
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:19,644
I can't watch this shit.

878
01:00:20,816 --> 01:00:22,340
Go on the road with the team.

879
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:24,712
You don't go on the road
with the team.

880
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,481
- That's why I want you to do it.
- Why don't you?

881
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:32,858
I can't develop personal relationships
with these guys.

882
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:37,556
I gotta be able to trade them,
send them down, sometimes cut them.

883
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:42,669
Which is something
you should learn to do, by the way.

884
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:48,434
I would never have to cut a player,
unless you...

885
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:52,203
- Oh, come on.
- "Come on" what?

886
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:54,882
- Let's practice.
- No.

887
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,917
Yeah. I'm a player.
You gotta cut me from the roster.

888
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,109
- No.
- Go.

889
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:00,754
- What do you mean, no?
- No.

890
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:02,548
- Do it.
- This is stupid.

891
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:05,118
Part of the job, man.

892
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,055
Fine.

893
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:15,837
Billy, please have a seat.
I need to talk to you for a minute.

894
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:17,528
Go on.

895
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,967
You've been a huge part
of this team.

896
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,941
But sometimes you have to
make decisions for the team.

897
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:25,704
I'm sure you can understand.

898
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,907
- You're cutting me?
- I'm really sorry.

899
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,242
I just bought a house here.

900
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:33,080
- Well...
- In Oakland.

901
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,417
Well... Well...

902
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,824
"Well... Well..."?
That's all you got to say?

903
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,363
My kid just started a new school.

904
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,866
- They made friends.
- That's...

905
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,234
You shouldn't pull them out
in the middle of the year.

906
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,273
- You should wait.
- What the hell are you talking about?

907
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:56,273
I don't know. I shouldn't have...

908
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:58,912
I'm not gonna do this.
I think this is stupid.

909
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:02,277
I'm not gonna fire anybody,
and this is dumb.

910
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:06,582
They're professional ballplayers.
Just be straight with them.

911
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,723
No fluff, just facts.

912
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:13,725
Pete, I gotta let you go.
Jack's office will handle the details.

913
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:17,988
That's it?

914
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:20,090
Really?

915
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:24,705
You rather get a bullet to the head or
five to the chest and bleed to death?

916
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,936
Are those my only two options?

917
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:31,305
Go on the road with the team.

918
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,541
Okay.

919
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,417
Say, bro.

920
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,620
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

921
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,664
How come your boss doesn't travel
with the team?

922
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:57,096
He doesn't like to mingle
with the players.

923
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,501
Is that supposed to make us
easier to cut?

924
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,842
I don't know. I don't know.

925
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:13,818
And how come soda
is a dollar in the clubhouse?

926
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,253
I never seen nothing like that.

927
01:03:17,526 --> 01:03:20,324
Billy likes to keep the money
on the field.

928
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:22,394
Soda money?

929
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:24,388
Really?

930
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:28,300
Where on the field
is the dollar I'm paying for soda?

931
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:33,339
It's hard to see exactly...

932
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:36,477
...but it's there, yeah.
- Yeah, it is hard to see.

933
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,670
I'm done.

934
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:52,588
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

935
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,763
- How are you?
- I'm good.

936
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:57,022
- Was it bumpy?
- It was okay.

937
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:02,163
<i>So with this loss tonight,
the Oakland Athletics...</i>

938
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:05,499
<i>...incredibly, have lost 14
of their last 17 games.</i>

939
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,669
<i>They are 10 games back
in the American League West.</i>

940
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:13,347
<i>Is it fair to say
the experiment has failed?</i>

941
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,847
<i>Well, absolutely. It was predictable.</i>

942
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,986
<i>You don't wish anybody
a lack of success...</i>

943
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,555
<i>...but the facts are in front of you.
- You can't blame Art Howe.</i>

944
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,783
<i>- No.
- The fact of the matter is...</i>

945
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:27,985
<i>...this is not about statistics,
this is about people.</i>

946
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,927
<i>Art Howe is not the problem.</i>

947
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,761
<i>The problem
is in the general manager's office...</i>

948
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:34,993
<i>...with Billy Beane.</i>

949
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,764
<i>The root of the problem for me
is philosophical.</i>

950
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:40,168
<i>I said it before.
This is fantasy baseball.</i>

951
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:42,142
<i>Billy is just not thinking.</i>

952
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:44,904
<i>Start thinking about a new GM,
making changes.</i>

953
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,513
<i>He never goes to the games.</i>

954
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:51,084
<i>- This was very predictable.
- He needs to look at what's going on.</i>

955
01:04:51,286 --> 01:04:54,722
<i>- The man needs to get real.
- I want Billy Beane gone.</i>

956
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:57,357
<i>Calling for Beane's head.
I want your thoughts.</i>

957
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:02,724
<i>The past 18 games, they've been
shut out or scored one run four times.</i>

958
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:04,592
<i>They're just not scoring enough.</i>

959
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,928
<i>It's not just the offense,
not Thad Bosley and the hitters.</i>

960
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:12,403
<i>It's everything. If there was one thing
you could pick out, you'd try to fix it...</i>

961
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:17,910
<i>...but just everything is in a funk
right now.</i>

962
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,076
What the hell am I doing?

963
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:30,219
Oh, man.

964
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,394
<i>Look, Steve.</i>

965
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:38,057
I believe in what we're doing.

966
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,100
The record doesn't reflect the strength
of this team...

967
01:05:41,303 --> 01:05:43,965
...or where we're gonna be
at the end of the season.

968
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:48,769
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly
that we stay on the track we've chosen.

969
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:51,468
Our sample size has been too small.
It's too...

970
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,307
Early. It's still early.

971
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:57,076
Where do we expect to be
by the All-Star break?

972
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,755
Our goal and our expectation...

973
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:04,687
...is by mid-July
to be within seven games of first.

974
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:06,292
That would be this working.

975
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,963
- That keeps us in the hunt.
- Exceptionally well.

976
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:12,398
- By July.
- July.

977
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:16,435
And what's gonna prevent you
from accomplishing that?

978
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:18,265
What are you afraid of?

979
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,341
Nothing.
That's why we're here, Steve.

980
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:24,842
That's why we get up in the morning.
That's all we do.

981
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:45,956
- More?
- Yeah, a little more.

982
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,604
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

983
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:52,465
- Chocolate sauce?
- Yes.

984
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,707
Stop.

985
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,281
- Big spoon or little spoon?
- Little spoon.

986
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:03,310
Thank you.

987
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,122
Dad, there's no way
you're gonna lose your job, right?

988
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,730
What?

989
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,967
- Well, I don't know. I'm just wondering.
- Where'd you hear that?

990
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,104
Well, I go on the Internet sometimes.

991
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,400
Well, don't do that.
Don't go on the Internet.

992
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:30,442
Or watch TV or read newspapers...

993
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:33,146
...or talk to people.

994
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:35,976
I don't talk to people.
I just read stuff.

995
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:38,778
Honey, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

996
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,386
Really, you don't have to worry.

997
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,923
But if you lose your job,
will you have to move away?

998
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:48,127
Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job.

999
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,533
You don't have to worry.

1000
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:56,268
- Okay.
- Hey.

1001
01:07:56,905 --> 01:08:00,238
- There's no problem.
- Okay.

1002
01:08:00,442 --> 01:08:03,741
All right? I got uptown problems,
which are not problems at all.

1003
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,111
You're not worried, right?

1004
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,806
- No, I'm not worried.
- Okay.

1005
01:08:16,124 --> 01:08:17,751
Peña.

1006
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:22,054
Okay.

1007
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,003
I want Dye in right...

1008
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:40,010
...Justice DH'ing,
Peña on the bench...

1009
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:41,944
...Hatteberg at first...

1010
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:45,176
...and anyone but Mags
first out of the pen.

1011
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,252
You want Peña on the bench?

1012
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,550
That's right. So you can play Hattie.

1013
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,954
Peña is not only
the best first baseman...

1014
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:55,288
...he's the only first baseman.

1015
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:57,863
Hattie gets on base more than Peña.

1016
01:08:58,066 --> 01:09:00,500
- In fact, 20 percent more.
- And his fielding?

1017
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:03,364
His fielding does not matter.

1018
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:06,601
- I've heard enough of this.
- Have you?

1019
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:08,366
And I...

1020
01:09:09,244 --> 01:09:12,179
I disagree with you,
plain and simple.

1021
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:15,275
And moreover,
I'm playing my team...

1022
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:19,446
...in a way that I can explain
in job interviews next winter.

1023
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,049
Okay?

1024
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:30,031
Hattie. Not Peña.

1025
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:35,767
What's up, skip?

1026
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,371
- How you doing?
- Good, how you doing, man?

1027
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:40,165
Get some sleep last night?

1028
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,404
<i>As the A's hit the field,
we are ready for baseball.</i>

1029
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,913
<i>First one out of the dugout
is rookie sensation Carlos Peña...</i>

1030
01:09:49,117 --> 01:09:54,020
<i>...one of the few bright lights in this
lineup, taking his spot at first base.</i>

1031
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:37,356
Billy, quick question. Do you expect
these guys to produce more or...?

1032
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,830
- Not now.
- What's the reason for the slump?

1033
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,677
Get down.

1034
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,826
Is losing fun?

1035
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,124
- Is losing fun?
- No.

1036
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:18,465
What are you having fun for?

1037
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,298
That's what losing sounds like.

1038
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,281
Are you okay, Dad?

1039
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:04,984
- You're doing it again.
- What?

1040
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,451
You're worrying about me.

1041
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:09,486
You're in last place, Dad.

1042
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:12,057
- Do I look worried?
- Yeah.

1043
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,162
Because you're getting on an airplane,
and those things crash all the time.

1044
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:18,764
Please stop worrying
about your dad.

1045
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:22,661
- We're all set.
- Okay.

1046
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,734
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1047
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:30,076
All right. Your dad's not in trouble.

1048
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,080
Okay.

1049
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,783
Yeah.

1050
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,921
- Suzanne, get me Ed Wade.
- Okay.

1051
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,825
- Coffee on?
- Yes.

1052
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,626
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Billy.

1053
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,035
Oh, hi, Louisa.

1054
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,107
- I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane.
- Hi.

1055
01:13:36,344 --> 01:13:37,333
Please hold.

1056
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:40,105
- What's up?
- Wade's on 2.

1057
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:41,748
- Ed?
- Hello?

1058
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,350
- Ed, it's Billy.
- Billy, what's up?

1059
01:13:44,552 --> 01:13:47,521
- Look, I need a little help on defense.
- Okay.

1060
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:50,247
I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi
for it.

1061
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,425
- Really?
- What?

1062
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:54,727
- Who you got?
- What?

1063
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,058
- Well, let me think.
- What are you doing?

1064
01:13:58,266 --> 01:13:59,460
Cleaning house.

1065
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,602
- Mabry?
- Maybe what?

1066
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:04,795
- No, Mabry.
- Hold on.

1067
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:06,837
- No.
- Why not?

1068
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,135
Because you can't trade
Jeremy Giambi.

1069
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:11,912
He'll be fine, Ed.

1070
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:14,673
<i>Why do I get the feeling
you're picking my pocket?</i>

1071
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:18,182
I'm not. You're picking mine.
Giambi's name alone is worth more.

1072
01:14:18,386 --> 01:14:20,547
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

1073
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:24,213
Can we say it's done in theory
and start drawing up the paperwork?

1074
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,621
- Okay, but you're gonna have...
- Great.

1075
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:28,489
He was gonna say something else.

1076
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,257
When you get the answer
you're looking for, hang up.

1077
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:32,455
- Suzanne.
- Yes?

1078
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:35,101
- David Dombrowski.
- Okay.

1079
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:38,238
- And Peña's going too.
- I don't think you should do that.

1080
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,877
- I really don't think you should do that.
- I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.

1081
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,409
You need to take a minute.

1082
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:47,706
I think you seriously need to think
about what you're doing.

1083
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,350
- Because you're upset.
- Okay.

1084
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:52,682
What am I missing?

1085
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:55,719
These are hard moves
to explain to people.

1086
01:14:56,624 --> 01:14:58,216
Why is that a problem, Pete?

1087
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,224
Don't make
an emotional decision, Billy.

1088
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:07,765
- David Dombrowski's on 3.
- Look, we're gonna shake things up.

1089
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:10,961
Dave. Peña's going on the block.
You're my first call.

1090
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,771
Because he's making the rest
of the team look bad.

1091
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,575
He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.

1092
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,873
- Probably an All-Star.
- He's an All-Star, Dave.

1093
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:24,546
No. I want a reliever and cash.

1094
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,749
Okay. You got five minutes, Dave.
I'm not waiting.

1095
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:33,257
Billy, Peña is an All-Star, okay?

1096
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:37,454
And if you dump him and this
Hatteberg thing doesn't work out...

1097
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:39,326
...you know this is...

1098
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:42,594
This is the kind of decision
that gets you fired.

1099
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,328
It is.

1100
01:15:44,906 --> 01:15:46,931
Yes, you're right.

1101
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,673
I may lose my job.

1102
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,245
In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy
with a high school diploma...

1103
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:56,713
...and a daughter
I'd like to be able to send to college.

1104
01:15:57,252 --> 01:16:00,278
You're 25 years old,
with a degree from Yale...

1105
01:16:00,488 --> 01:16:03,013
...and a pretty impressive
apprenticeship.

1106
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,622
I don't think
we're asking the right question.

1107
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:10,097
I think the question
we should be asking is...

1108
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:12,926
...do you believe in this thing or not?

1109
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:16,360
I do.

1110
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:22,467
It's a problem you think
we need to explain ourselves.

1111
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:25,840
Don't. To anyone.

1112
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,683
Okay.

1113
01:16:33,254 --> 01:16:36,690
Now, I'm gonna see this thing through,
for better or worse.

1114
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:44,962
Just tell me, do you project we'll win
more with Hatteberg or Peña at first?

1115
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,000
It's close...

1116
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,237
...but theoretically, Hatteberg.

1117
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:57,100
- What are we talking about, then?
- Dombrowski's on again, on 3.

1118
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:00,880
Yeah?

1119
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,481
Okay, that'll work.

1120
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:06,415
Great. I need one more thing.

1121
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:09,818
Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys
paying for soda.

1122
01:17:10,024 --> 01:17:12,686
I want you to stock my machine
for three years.

1123
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,327
I'm serious.

1124
01:17:15,396 --> 01:17:17,364
Great. It's a deal.

1125
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,434
Go tell Peña he's gotta pack.

1126
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,133
- You want me to tell Peña?
- Part of the job.

1127
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:30,075
What about Giambi?
You want me to tell him too?

1128
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,212
I'll tell him.

1129
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,745
- Excuse me, Carlos?
- Yeah?

1130
01:17:40,955 --> 01:17:42,889
- Can I speak with you a minute?
- Yeah.

1131
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:54,226
Carlos, you've been traded
to the Tigers.

1132
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,707
This is Jay Palmer's number.

1133
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,433
He's the traveling secretary
for the team.

1134
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,636
He's expecting your call.
He'll take care of everything.

1135
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:17,390
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1136
01:18:24,732 --> 01:18:26,131
Okay.

1137
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,946
Okay.

1138
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,710
Art, you got a minute?

1139
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:50,013
Yeah. Take a seat.

1140
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:57,760
You can't start Peña at first tonight.
You'll have to start Hatteberg.

1141
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:03,603
I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy.
The lineup card is mine, and that's all.

1142
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,796
That lineup card is definitely yours.

1143
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,532
I'm just saying you can't start Peña
at first.

1144
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,772
Well, I am starting him at first.

1145
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:17,918
I don't think so.
He plays for Detroit now.

1146
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:24,016
You traded Peña?

1147
01:19:25,226 --> 01:19:26,716
Yeah.

1148
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:31,331
And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam
are all being sent down.

1149
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:35,764
- You are outside your mind.
- Yeah. Cuckoo.

1150
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:40,369
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat.

1151
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:46,446
Jeremy, you've been traded
to the Phillies.

1152
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:49,242
This is Ed Wade's number.
He's a good guy, the GM.

1153
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,748
He's expecting your call.

1154
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,751
Buddy will help you
with the plane flight.

1155
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,786
You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy...

1156
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:01,484
...and we wish you the best.

1157
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,105
Jeremy's gone too.

1158
01:20:22,116 --> 01:20:24,175
You're killing this team.

1159
01:20:24,385 --> 01:20:28,048
Art, I can do this all day long.

1160
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:35,526
Hey.

1161
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,556
You agree with this?

1162
01:20:39,967 --> 01:20:41,628
Hundred percent.

1163
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:44,728
You want this door closed?

1164
01:20:57,318 --> 01:20:59,752
- Scotty H.
- Sir?

1165
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:04,417
- Go field some grounders.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,388
Everybody, listen up.

1167
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:12,160
You may not look
like a winning team...

1168
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:17,495
...but you are one.

1169
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,837
So play like one tonight.

1170
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:37,684
Oh, shit.

1171
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,958
When you're getting your pitch,
you're hitting .625, massive.

1172
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:45,962
You're crushing the ball.

1173
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,000
But when you swing at things...
Your pitch is middle-in.

1174
01:21:49,203 --> 01:21:52,036
When you're swinging low and away,
you're batting .158.

1175
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,265
Every at bat's
like a hand of blackjack.

1176
01:21:54,475 --> 01:21:56,773
Every card that's dealt,
your odds change.

1177
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:01,278
So every first-pitch strike, your batting
average goes down about 75 points.

1178
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:02,608
Seventy-five points.

1179
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,047
He should throw 100 pitches
before the fifth.

1180
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,982
You wanna knock that starter out.

1181
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,646
I want you taking at bats off the 10th
and 11 th pitcher by the end.

1182
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:13,224
This is your basic breakdown
of the pitches...

1183
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,589
...where you should be hitting them,
why.

1184
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:19,324
- So you want us to walk more?
- Good question. Yes.

1185
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:22,793
Mr. Justice.

1186
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:24,938
- Had a few thoughts.
- Yeah?

1187
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:27,471
- Yeah.
- Gonna teach me some things?

1188
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:29,636
Excuse me?

1189
01:22:31,245 --> 01:22:33,475
Never seen a GM talk to players
like that.

1190
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:36,343
You never seen a GM
who was a player.

1191
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,421
- We got a problem, David?
- No, it's okay.

1192
01:22:45,626 --> 01:22:47,787
I know your routine.

1193
01:22:47,995 --> 01:22:51,226
It's patter. It's for effect.

1194
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:56,663
But it's for them, all right?
That shit ain't for me.

1195
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:58,933
Oh, you're special?

1196
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:05,971
You're paying me 7 million bucks
a year, man, so, yeah...

1197
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,478
...maybe I am, a little bit.

1198
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:11,618
No, man, I ain't paying you 7.

1199
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:14,218
Yankees are paying half your salary.

1200
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:17,186
That's what the New York Yankees
think of you.

1201
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:22,358
They're paying you $3.5 million
to play against them.

1202
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,825
Where you going with this, Billy?

1203
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:28,965
David, you're 37.

1204
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:32,901
How about you and I be honest about
what each of us want out of this?

1205
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,875
I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball
you got in you.

1206
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,343
And you wanna stay in the show.

1207
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:42,848
Let's do that.

1208
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:46,309
I'm not paying you
for the player you used to be.

1209
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,490
I'm paying you for the player you are
right now.

1210
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:53,091
You're smart.
You get what we're trying to do here.

1211
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:56,058
Make an example
for the younger guys.

1212
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,027
Be a leader.

1213
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,360
Can you do that?

1214
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:10,409
All right. I got you.

1215
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,609
We're cool?

1216
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:18,150
We're cool.

1217
01:24:23,457 --> 01:24:24,651
Scotty H.

1218
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:27,657
- Yo, what's up, D.J.?
- Picking machine.

1219
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,528
How you liking first base, man?

1220
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:35,029
It's coming along. Picking it up.

1221
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:39,332
You know, tough transition,
but I'm starting to feel better with it.

1222
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,531
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1223
01:24:41,742 --> 01:24:43,607
What's your biggest fear?

1224
01:24:44,278 --> 01:24:46,940
A baseball being hit
in my general direction.

1225
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:52,177
That's funny. Seriously, what is it?

1226
01:24:55,656 --> 01:24:57,954
No, seriously, that is.

1227
01:25:08,769 --> 01:25:11,067
Well, hey, good luck with that.

1228
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,399
Be social out there.

1229
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:16,867
- Social.
- Social. Like a greeter at the Gap.

1230
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,103
Guy steps into your office,
chat him up.

1231
01:25:19,313 --> 01:25:21,941
You're well-read.
You went to school.

1232
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:24,276
- Yeah.
- Have some fun. Relax.

1233
01:25:24,485 --> 01:25:27,352
Everyone wants to attack.
Quit trying to attack.

1234
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:30,752
Let the game come to you, man.
There's no clock on this thing.

1235
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,357
This is a war of attrition.

1236
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,929
If I take more, I could even take
a few strikes, but I'll get walked more.

1237
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:40,862
You get on base, we win.
You don't, we lose.

1238
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:44,367
And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it.

1239
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:47,097
I hate losing
more than I even wanna win.

1240
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,605
And there's a difference.

1241
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:50,276
- No bunts.
- Bunts is an out.

1242
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:53,709
- Even if the third baseman is back?
- No bunting whatsoever.

1243
01:25:53,914 --> 01:25:56,610
If someone bunts on us,
throw it to first.

1244
01:25:56,817 --> 01:25:58,512
Don't be a hero and go to second.

1245
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,118
Let them make the mistakes.

1246
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,222
When your enemy's making mistakes,
don't interrupt them.

1247
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,915
They're giving you an out.
Just giving it to you.

1248
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,355
Take it. Say thank you.

1249
01:26:07,561 --> 01:26:09,529
Another thing. No more stealing.

1250
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:11,755
That's what I do,
what you pay me to do.

1251
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,867
I pay you to get on first,
not get thrown out at second.

1252
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:20,006
This is a process.
It's a process, it's a process. Okay?

1253
01:26:32,386 --> 01:26:36,220
<i>Jason takes it, goes to second
for the only out, and the A's get a run.</i>

1254
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:41,953
<i>Jermaine Dye homers again,
his second in two games.</i>

1255
01:26:43,497 --> 01:26:46,591
<i>And the A's are still hanging in.
We'll get you scores here.</i>

1256
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:51,204
<i>The A's pull within two
of the Angels for the wild-card chase.</i>

1257
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:53,532
<i>The Reds have now dropped
five in a row...</i>

1258
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:57,108
<i>...as Oakland beats them
in the beginning of this series 5 to 3.</i>

1259
01:26:57,311 --> 01:26:58,608
<i>Tejada walks.</i>

1260
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,110
<i>Ball four.</i>

1261
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:03,147
<i>Ball four and Hatteberg walks.</i>

1262
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,177
<i>What is happening in Oakland?
The A's have won seven in a row.</i>

1263
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,584
<i>A lot of excitement.
What a winning streak.</i>

1264
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:13,589
<i>But how about the calming influence
of Art Howe?</i>

1265
01:27:13,794 --> 01:27:17,389
When you say "your source,"
if it's not me or Peter, they don't know.

1266
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:19,259
He's managing
an unorthodox team.

1267
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:21,230
- Right.
- It's not a perfect roster.

1268
01:27:21,435 --> 01:27:24,700
<i>But right now, Art Howe is the reason
this team is winning.</i>

1269
01:27:24,905 --> 01:27:27,465
- He deserves the credit.
- Great, thanks. Bye.

1270
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,165
Did you hear that?

1271
01:27:29,376 --> 01:27:32,311
I heard "seven in a row."
You get the Cleveland matchups?

1272
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:34,378
Yeah, right here.

1273
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:43,589
- Voos.
- Billy.

1274
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:47,022
- That smell is getting worse.
- I'm on it.

1275
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,922
- What are we doing?
- Splitting it in half?

1276
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:51,928
- Both sides of the plate.
- Got it.

1277
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:54,827
- Huddy. Mix it up.
- Yes, sir.

1278
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:57,128
- Trust your slider, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

1279
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:59,306
You guys quit distracting him.

1280
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:02,203
You couldn't hit that shit last night
with a paddle.

1281
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:04,206
You gotta see more pitches.

1282
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:06,879
- All right, Billy.
- Patience.

1283
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:12,276
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Billy.

1284
01:28:12,486 --> 01:28:13,817
- Great at bats.
- Thank you.

1285
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:15,545
- Really quality.
- Thank you.

1286
01:28:15,756 --> 01:28:18,418
<i>Base hit to right field.
Tejada scores.</i>

1287
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:21,459
<i>Chavez coming in.
The ball gets past Guiel.</i>

1288
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:26,490
<i>The A's, from 5-nothing down,
now lead 6 to 5.</i>

1289
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:39,513
<i>The Oakland A's are completely
out of hand at the moment.</i>

1290
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:42,341
<i>They are an AL-best 17 and 4
this month.</i>

1291
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:46,316
<i>They also took back-to-back series
at Boston and at New York.</i>

1292
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,114
<i>Remember when they traded
Jeremy Giambi in June...</i>

1293
01:28:49,323 --> 01:28:51,621
<i>...and everyone thought
they'd just given up?</i>

1294
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,454
<i>Actually, not so much.</i>

1295
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:01,029
<i>Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.</i>

1296
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:04,730
- You thinking Rincon?
- His season's done. He's lost faith.

1297
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,908
- I think he's gonna dump him.
- Hard-core.

1298
01:29:08,108 --> 01:29:10,338
Shapiro on 2.

1299
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,675
Mark, Billy. Let's be honest.

1300
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:17,214
A premier setup man isn't
gonna get you closer to the play-offs.

1301
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:21,479
- Are you referring to Rincon?
- He's a luxury you can't afford, man.

1302
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,351
<i>And you can?
There's half a million on his contract.</i>

1303
01:29:24,558 --> 01:29:26,583
<i>And we've got
at least one other suitor.</i>

1304
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:29,456
By "at least one," you mean one.

1305
01:29:29,663 --> 01:29:32,097
- Who is it?
- I'd rather not say.

1306
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:34,563
- San Francisco.
- San Francisco.

1307
01:29:34,768 --> 01:29:36,235
I'll call you back.

1308
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,199
What do you think we can get
for Magnante?

1309
01:29:40,407 --> 01:29:41,635
Nothing.

1310
01:29:42,576 --> 01:29:45,602
- What's left on Venafro's contract?
- Two seventy-five.

1311
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:48,210
Suzanne,
get me Sabean on the line.

1312
01:29:48,415 --> 01:29:52,476
Get the Giants interested in Venafro,
Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon.

1313
01:29:52,686 --> 01:29:54,085
- Us.
- On 3.

1314
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:59,626
Saby-Sabster, it's Billy.
What do you think of Venafro?

1315
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,954
I can let you have him
for almost nothing.

1316
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:04,687
- Why would you do that?
- Because I'm amazing.

1317
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,867
I want a couple bucks
and a sweetener.

1318
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:09,131
Throw in, say...

1319
01:30:09,336 --> 01:30:11,463
- Anderson.
- Anderson.

1320
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:14,573
- I like Anderson.
- No, you don't. Nobody likes him.

1321
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:17,266
I don't know why I'm doing this.
But let's do it.

1322
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:20,379
Venafro for Michaelson. Anderson.
I don't know his name.

1323
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:23,414
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it and call me back.

1324
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,986
Get Shapiro on.

1325
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:36,123
Shapiro's on 2.

1326
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:40,166
- Mark.
- You can't afford him, Billy.

1327
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:41,391
You sure about that?

1328
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,765
I get the impression
the market for Rincon is softening.

1329
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,736
I could be wrong,
but I'd call whoever's interested...

1330
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:51,400
...and see if they're still interested.
Call me back.

1331
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,680
- What about the Mets for Venafro?
- You offered him to the Giants.

1332
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:57,510
<i>Suzanne, Steve Phillips.</i>

1333
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:02,485
Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow,
San Francisco's never gonna do it.

1334
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:06,654
- Totally agree.
- We just need them to cool on Rincon.

1335
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:09,954
- Phillips on 2.
- Steve-o, it's Billy.

1336
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:13,827
I hear you're looking for a reliever.
I can give you Venafro.

1337
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:16,525
- I can make it quick and easy.
- What's the angle?

1338
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:19,706
- No angle.
- Who am I getting fleeced for?

1339
01:31:20,374 --> 01:31:23,741
- Hang on a sec.
- Bennett, maybe?

1340
01:31:23,944 --> 01:31:25,275
- How old?
- Twenty-six.

1341
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:27,538
Twenty-six, Double-A? Forget it.

1342
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:29,773
<i>Duncan, no.</i>

1343
01:31:31,618 --> 01:31:33,313
<i>No. Furbush, no.</i>

1344
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:39,686
Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.

1345
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:42,795
- Eckerton.
- Eckerton? I like Eckerton.

1346
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:46,228
- You don't even know who Eckerton is.
- Is Venafro hurt?

1347
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:49,698
No, he's fine, he's fine.
It's just an issue for us.

1348
01:31:49,903 --> 01:31:52,565
- Last couple times, he got hammered.
- Not his fault.

1349
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:54,900
- That was us. We misused him.
- It's Steve.

1350
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:57,077
- I'm almost done.
- Steve Schott.

1351
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:00,446
Look, Steve-o,
let me be straight with you.

1352
01:32:00,647 --> 01:32:03,411
Here's the deal.
I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal.

1353
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:06,643
- I heard the Giants...
- Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.

1354
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:08,719
- Anderson.
- I'd rather deal with you.

1355
01:32:08,922 --> 01:32:11,914
You can give me Eckerton
and $225,000 in cash...

1356
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:14,117
...and the Giants can't.

1357
01:32:14,995 --> 01:32:16,986
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

1358
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:19,529
But whoever calls me back first
gets Venafro.

1359
01:32:22,002 --> 01:32:23,162
Schott hung up.

1360
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:27,936
Oh, I want this one.

1361
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:38,247
Why isn't anybody calling?

1362
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,283
Shapiro's on 2.

1363
01:32:44,691 --> 01:32:46,056
Yeah?

1364
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:52,858
Okay, let me talk to my owner.
I'll call you back.

1365
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,729
- Get Steve on the phone.
- Schott or Phillips?

1366
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,769
Why would we call Phillips?
Phillips has gotta call us.

1367
01:33:02,676 --> 01:33:04,371
Tell him I'm on the other line.

1368
01:33:08,148 --> 01:33:11,777
Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand.
I apologize for putting you on hold.

1369
01:33:11,985 --> 01:33:16,752
- Billy asked me to call you back.
- Tell him we want $225,000 for Rincon.

1370
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:21,951
<i>Billy says he needs $225,000
for Ricardo Rincon.</i>

1371
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,121
<i>Please.</i>

1372
01:33:25,699 --> 01:33:28,930
<i>Yes, I added the "please" at the end.</i>

1373
01:33:30,337 --> 01:33:33,568
Okay. Let me...
Hold on one second, please.

1374
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:36,376
Tell him I'll pay for him.

1375
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:40,877
But when I sell him back for twice the
amount next year, I keep the money.

1376
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:45,852
Okay, so Billy says
he'll pay for Rincon himself.

1377
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:50,285
But when he sells him for more money
next year, he's keeping the profit.

1378
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:02,929
Thank you very much.
We'll call you back. Thank you.

1379
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,731
Come on. Come on.

1380
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:14,677
Suzanne, call Shapiro ba...
Never mind, I got him right here.

1381
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:19,281
Mark. Yeah.

1382
01:34:19,486 --> 01:34:22,387
Listen, I don't want Rincon
pitching against me tonight.

1383
01:34:22,589 --> 01:34:26,025
Tell him to change clothes and
send him over. I got you the money.

1384
01:34:26,226 --> 01:34:27,625
Yup.

1385
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,227
Great.

1386
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:37,359
I don't wanna dampen the mood at all,
but since we picked up Rincon...

1387
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:39,801
We gotta send someone down.

1388
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:49,539
- Mags.
- Hey, Billy.

1389
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,384
I know I've been struggling lately.

1390
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:58,319
But second half of the season,
definitely turn it around. Ricky and I...

1391
01:34:58,525 --> 01:35:02,427
Mike, I need you
to stop getting dressed.

1392
01:35:04,998 --> 01:35:06,556
Traded?

1393
01:35:17,444 --> 01:35:19,844
I'm sorry for the crap news.

1394
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:22,547
I know it hurts.

1395
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:35,590
Mike, I can't have 26 guys
in the clubhouse.

1396
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:38,731
I get it. I get it.

1397
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:43,164
Okay. Thanks.

1398
01:35:57,451 --> 01:35:59,510
Hey, Ricardo.

1399
01:36:00,954 --> 01:36:03,548
This must be a bit of a shock,
I guess.

1400
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:06,455
<i>Mabry hits one
deep to right-center field.</i>

1401
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,628
<i>Racing back, Fick can't get it.</i>

1402
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:12,424
<i>It bounces to the wall.
One run is in. Two runs are in.</i>

1403
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:16,164
<i>Mabry, on one pitch,
has shot the A's in front.</i>

1404
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:20,665
<i>Strike three called.
Twelve straight wins for the Athletics.</i>

1405
01:36:20,874 --> 01:36:22,239
<i>Man alive, was it hairy.</i>

1406
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:24,808
<i>Something strange is now happening
in Oakland.</i>

1407
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:27,412
<i>- You cannot argue that point.
- Twelve straight.</i>

1408
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:30,481
<i>They're making a joke
out of the American League.</i>

1409
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:33,244
<i>- They were in Detroit today...
- He throws to first.</i>

1410
01:36:33,453 --> 01:36:36,945
<i>And that's the sound
of 14 straight victories.</i>

1411
01:36:37,157 --> 01:36:39,182
Fourteen, the longest run this year.

1412
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:42,021
<i>It has slingshot the A's into first
in the AL West.</i>

1413
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:44,424
<i>- A nice streak.
- This team was written off.</i>

1414
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:48,067
<i>How do you explain, otherwise,
the victories they've come up with?</i>

1415
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:51,760
<i>The Oakland A's are gonna win
16 consecutive games.</i>

1416
01:36:52,839 --> 01:36:57,640
<i>This is the longest win streak
in baseball, folks, in 25 years.</i>

1417
01:36:59,746 --> 01:37:03,614
<i>- The A's have won 16 in a row.
- We're going to 20! We're going to 20!</i>

1418
01:37:03,817 --> 01:37:08,015
<i>To have a winning streak of
this duration, you have to be good...</i>

1419
01:37:08,221 --> 01:37:11,122
<i>...but there's an element
of randomness to it.</i>

1420
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,486
<i>The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig...</i>

1421
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:16,788
<i>...Murderers' Row, some people
still say the best team ever.</i>

1422
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:20,489
<i>Longest winning streak
for them that year? Nine.</i>

1423
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:23,670
<i>You guys try to analyze it
from a numbers standpoint.</i>

1424
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:27,897
<i>I'm telling you, there is no explanation
for what's occurring right now.</i>

1425
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:29,871
<i>Do you have superstitions
going on?</i>

1426
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:32,443
<i>Do you do things
so you keep the streak alive?</i>

1427
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:36,138
<i>The all-time record of 20
does not seem impossible anymore.</i>

1428
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,648
<i>The A's were on page one
of the New York Times.</i>

1429
01:37:38,852 --> 01:37:42,185
<i>They are the story in sports
in this entire country.</i>

1430
01:37:42,389 --> 01:37:43,720
<i>Two-two pitch, here it is.</i>

1431
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:47,587
<i>Swing and a miss! Struck him out!
Number 17!</i>

1432
01:37:49,296 --> 01:37:51,093
<i>It's taken 71 years.</i>

1433
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:54,165
<i>The Oakland A's
have tied the Philadelphia A's.</i>

1434
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:58,236
<i>The all-time franchise record
17 straight...</i>

1435
01:37:58,438 --> 01:38:03,671
<i>...and baseball's longest
winning streak since 1953.</i>

1436
01:38:03,877 --> 01:38:07,779
<i>The A's are two wins away from
tying the American League record.</i>

1437
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:13,613
<i>It's gone! It's gone!
Tejada wins it! Do you believe it?</i>

1438
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:16,248
<i>Eighteen wins in a row!</i>

1439
01:38:16,456 --> 01:38:19,357
<i>You could replay these 18 games
a hundred times over.</i>

1440
01:38:19,559 --> 01:38:21,424
<i>And nobody wins 18 straight again.</i>

1441
01:38:21,628 --> 01:38:24,153
<i>It defies everything we know
about baseball.</i>

1442
01:38:25,732 --> 01:38:27,927
<i>The most amazing thing
you could imagine...</i>

1443
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:31,070
<i>...happened over the last four days
at the Coliseum.</i>

1444
01:38:31,271 --> 01:38:36,800
<i>Tejada, up the middle.
The A's have won 19 in a row!</i>

1445
01:38:37,744 --> 01:38:40,269
<i>The 1906 White Sox...</i>

1446
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:44,473
<i>...the 1947 New York Yankees
have company.</i>

1447
01:38:45,752 --> 01:38:50,280
<i>- Nineteen in a row.
- The A's have a date with destiny.</i>

1448
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:53,516
<i>They're going for the all-time
American League record...</i>

1449
01:38:53,727 --> 01:38:54,785
<i>...20 games in a row.</i>

1450
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:55,984
<i>We're going to 20!</i>

1451
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:59,256
<i>We're gonna take the AL record
to 20, baby!</i>

1452
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:03,999
<i>Don't tell me the score, Pete.</i>

1453
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:05,364
<i>No, Billy, it's me.</i>

1454
01:39:05,572 --> 01:39:07,938
- Sharon?
- Yeah.

1455
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:12,304
- You have a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

1456
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,878
<i>Well, I didn't actually expect you
to pick up.</i>

1457
01:39:15,081 --> 01:39:17,049
<i>I was gonna leave a message.</i>

1458
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:20,853
<i>Casey and I, we're here
and watching the game at home.</i>

1459
01:39:21,054 --> 01:39:24,649
<i>And I just wanted to say...</i>

1460
01:39:26,059 --> 01:39:27,754
<i>...you did good, Billy.</i>

1461
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:29,952
<i>We're really proud of you.</i>

1462
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:33,796
I appreciate it, Sharon.

1463
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,833
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1464
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:38,660
Okay.

1465
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:41,170
<i>Oh, Casey wants to talk to you.
Hang on.</i>

1466
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:43,771
<i>Hey are you on your way
to the stadium?</i>

1467
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:46,969
No, I'm on my way to Visalia
to see our minor-league team.

1468
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:49,910
- Turn around, please, Dad.
- No way, Jose.

1469
01:39:50,116 --> 01:39:52,778
- Turn around. Come on, Dad.
- Nope. Not gonna happen.

1470
01:39:52,986 --> 01:39:54,283
<i>You're not gonna jinx it.</i>

1471
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:58,015
I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.
I love you.

1472
01:40:04,564 --> 01:40:05,929
Shit.

1473
01:40:06,132 --> 01:40:09,226
<i>One out here in the fourth,
and if you're just joining us...</i>

1474
01:40:09,436 --> 01:40:10,460
<i>...you missed a lot.</i>

1475
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:13,662
<i>And the pitch to Raúl Ibañez.
Strike one.</i>

1476
01:40:13,874 --> 01:40:15,535
<i>I think my recap will be simple.</i>

1477
01:40:15,742 --> 01:40:19,371
<i>The A's scored six in the first,
one in the second, four in the third.</i>

1478
01:40:19,579 --> 01:40:22,776
<i>And people would be shocked
if you just did that.</i>

1479
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,545
<i>Eleven to nothing, the A's do lead.</i>

1480
01:40:25,752 --> 01:40:28,448
- Shit.
- Foul off the foot of Ibañez...

1481
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:53,538
Let's go, Oakland!

1482
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,272
Let's go, Oakland!

1483
01:40:56,483 --> 01:40:59,043
Let's go, Oakland!

1484
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:10,588
Now batting, number 2,
catcher, Brent Mayne.

1485
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:18,704
- Oakland!
- Here we go, Oakland!

1486
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:28,872
Two.

1487
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:32,177
Safe.

1488
01:41:37,557 --> 01:41:40,492
<i>Now batting, number 18...</i>

1489
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:44,824
<i>...left fielder Raúl Ibañez.</i>

1490
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:47,584
Safe.

1491
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:52,396
<i>And the A's now lead by a score
of 11 to 3.</i>

1492
01:42:52,599 --> 01:42:55,363
<i>A nice cushion,
but you don't wanna give teams life...</i>

1493
01:42:55,568 --> 01:42:59,470
<i>...and let them wedge their way
back in, even when you're...</i>

1494
01:43:42,248 --> 01:43:43,943
<i>Nobody out, the bases loaded.</i>

1495
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:47,449
<i>And Art Howe on the way to the
mound to make a pitching change.</i>

1496
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:49,519
<i>And this game is still in a state...</i>

1497
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:52,590
<i>...where it could get out of control
for the Athletics.</i>

1498
01:43:59,332 --> 01:44:02,529
<i>We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.</i>

1499
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:06,297
<i>We just don't know
when that's gonna be.</i>

1500
01:44:09,909 --> 01:44:15,347
<i>Some of us are told at 18, some of us
are told at 40, but we're all told.</i>

1501
01:44:15,548 --> 01:44:17,846
<i>Mike Sweeney with runners
at first and third.</i>

1502
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:20,417
<i>It's an 11-to-7 game,
the A's in front.</i>

1503
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:23,316
<i>Tam peering in for the sign.</i>

1504
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:26,458
<i>Two out. Runners at first and third.</i>

1505
01:44:26,659 --> 01:44:29,093
<i>And the 3-2 delivery.</i>

1506
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:05,160
<i>It's weird, Billy.</i>

1507
01:45:05,365 --> 01:45:09,392
<i>You wanna give up baseball
to become a scout?</i>

1508
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:13,136
<i>I'm not a baseball player.</i>

1509
01:45:13,606 --> 01:45:16,006
<i>Are you sure this is what you want?</i>

1510
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:21,938
<i>The crowd is roaring.
Koch is ready. One-two pitch.</i>

1511
01:45:22,448 --> 01:45:25,679
<i>Alicea puts it in play,
a looper to left field for a base hit.</i>

1512
01:45:25,885 --> 01:45:29,286
<i>Around third, tearing for the plate,
here comes the tying run.</i>

1513
01:45:29,522 --> 01:45:33,481
<i>Sliding safe.
And the ball game is tied at 11-all.</i>

1514
01:45:33,693 --> 01:45:35,285
<i>Holy Toledo.</i>

1515
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:40,861
<i>The A's have blown
an 11-to-nothing lead.</i>

1516
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:46,730
<i>This is the specter of a development
that has been lurking now...</i>

1517
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:51,303
<i>...ever since the five-run fourth inning
by the Royals.</i>

1518
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:56,915
<i>And the A's date with destiny
is on hold right now.</i>

1519
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:25,773
Hatteberg. Hattie.

1520
01:46:26,312 --> 01:46:28,746
Grab a bat.
You're hitting for Byrnesy.

1521
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:33,616
Come on, let's go.
Get yourself loose.

1522
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:47,831
<i>Hitting for Eric Byrnes...</i>

1523
01:46:48,034 --> 01:46:52,164
<i>...number 10, Scott Hatteberg.</i>

1524
01:47:00,346 --> 01:47:03,907
<i>In your typical A's fashion,
they want a base runner here.</i>

1525
01:47:04,117 --> 01:47:07,814
<i>Scott Hatteberg is so adept
at drawing walks.</i>

1526
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:13,287
<i>He's looking for Hatteberg
to get on base...</i>

1527
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:15,461
<i>...maybe bring in a pinch runner.</i>

1528
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:18,062
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1529
01:47:18,264 --> 01:47:20,289
<i>Let's go, Oakland!</i>

1530
01:48:15,154 --> 01:48:16,917
<i>That one is gone!</i>

1531
01:48:17,123 --> 01:48:21,560
<i>And it's 20 consecutive victories
for the Oakland Athletics...</i>

1532
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:23,752
<i>...on an unbelievable night...</i>

1533
01:48:23,963 --> 01:48:26,591
<i>...when they lost
an 11-to-nothing lead...</i>

1534
01:48:26,799 --> 01:48:29,131
<i>...and now they win it.</i>

1535
01:48:30,503 --> 01:48:34,963
<i>The crowd comes back
to insane life.</i>

1536
01:48:36,909 --> 01:48:38,877
<i>How do you explain it?</i>

1537
01:48:39,879 --> 01:48:44,179
<i>Crazy. Just plain crazy.</i>

1538
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:51,848
<i>Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.</i>

1539
01:48:55,128 --> 01:48:58,063
<i>In 103 years
of American League baseball...</i>

1540
01:48:58,264 --> 01:49:01,700
<i>...the Athletics have accomplished
what no one has before.</i>

1541
01:49:01,901 --> 01:49:06,099
<i>They have won
20 consecutive games.</i>

1542
01:49:32,131 --> 01:49:34,895
<i>It's hard not to be romantic
about baseball.</i>

1543
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:40,034
<i>This kind of thing,
it's fun for the fans.</i>

1544
01:49:40,973 --> 01:49:44,374
<i>It sells tickets and hot dogs.</i>

1545
01:49:45,711 --> 01:49:47,269
<i>Doesn't mean anything.</i>

1546
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:51,075
<i>Billy, we just won 20 games
in a row.</i>

1547
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:54,843
And what's the point?

1548
01:49:55,054 --> 01:49:57,682
We just got the record.

1549
01:50:00,626 --> 01:50:02,992
Man, I've been doing this for...

1550
01:50:09,035 --> 01:50:11,060
Listen, man.

1551
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:14,706
I've been in this game a long time.

1552
01:50:16,342 --> 01:50:19,072
I'm not in it for a record,
I'll tell you that.

1553
01:50:19,278 --> 01:50:21,371
I'm not in it for a ring.

1554
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:26,278
That's when people get hurt.

1555
01:50:27,954 --> 01:50:30,855
If we don't win the last game
of the Series...

1556
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,116
...they'll dismiss us.

1557
01:50:34,727 --> 01:50:36,126
- Billy...
- I know these guys.

1558
01:50:36,329 --> 01:50:39,196
I know the way they think,
and they will erase us.

1559
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,168
And everything we've done here...

1560
01:50:43,369 --> 01:50:45,269
...none of it'll matter.

1561
01:50:48,374 --> 01:50:51,673
Any other team wins the World Series,
good for them.

1562
01:50:52,912 --> 01:50:56,211
They're drinking champagne,
they get a ring.

1563
01:50:56,415 --> 01:50:58,315
But if we win...

1564
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:01,579
...on our budget, with this team...

1565
01:51:05,391 --> 01:51:07,416
...we'll have changed the game.

1566
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:10,354
And that's what I want.

1567
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:12,793
I want it to mean something.

1568
01:51:22,475 --> 01:51:25,569
<i>The A's going to the play-offs
with the West Division title.</i>

1569
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,475
<i>Forgive the A's
if they're not celebrating.</i>

1570
01:51:29,682 --> 01:51:31,172
<i>They have been here before...</i>

1571
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:35,081
<i>...when Oakland went up two games
to none on the Yanks in the ALDS...</i>

1572
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:37,756
<i>...and went nowhere
after losing three straight.</i>

1573
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:41,222
<i>With a win today over the Twins,
Oakland moves into the ALCS...</i>

1574
01:51:41,427 --> 01:51:44,760
<i>...for the first time since 1992.
- But remember one thing.</i>

1575
01:51:46,165 --> 01:51:49,965
<i>Percentages hold up over a season,
but for one game, one at bat...</i>

1576
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:52,660
<i>...throw the percentages
out the window.</i>

1577
01:52:25,504 --> 01:52:29,998
<i>What the Minnesota Twins exposed
is the fact that the Oakland A's...</i>

1578
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:33,940
<i>...were fundamentally
not a sound baseball team.</i>

1579
01:52:34,146 --> 01:52:37,604
<i>They had a flawed concept that
started with the general manager...</i>

1580
01:52:37,817 --> 01:52:41,275
<i>...and the brain trust
thinking they could reinvent baseball.</i>

1581
01:52:41,487 --> 01:52:43,045
<i>You can't approach baseball...</i>

1582
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:45,884
<i>...from a statistical,
bean-counting point of view.</i>

1583
01:52:46,092 --> 01:52:48,322
<i>It's won on the field
with fundamental play.</i>

1584
01:52:48,527 --> 01:52:51,553
<i>You have to steal, you have to bunt,
you have to sacrifice.</i>

1585
01:52:51,764 --> 01:52:55,325
<i>You gotta get men in scoring position,
and you gotta bring them in.</i>

1586
01:52:55,534 --> 01:52:59,937
<i>And you don't do that
with a bunch of statistical gimmicks.</i>

1587
01:53:00,139 --> 01:53:02,937
<i>Nobody reinvents this game.</i>

1588
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:47,584
Yeah.

1589
01:54:56,155 --> 01:55:01,616
<i>Due respect to the Coliseum,
but this is a ballpark.</i>

1590
01:55:01,827 --> 01:55:03,795
Yes, it is.

1591
01:55:05,898 --> 01:55:08,128
We're gonna have some lunch
in a little bit.

1592
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:10,529
Why don't I have some coffee
sent up?

1593
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:12,932
Denise?

1594
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:19,441
Thank you, Denise.

1595
01:55:19,645 --> 01:55:21,670
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1596
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:28,279
You know, it's her birthday
and I need to get her a present...

1597
01:55:28,487 --> 01:55:31,422
...but she's usually the one
that does that for me.

1598
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:34,456
So do you have any ideas?

1599
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:36,391
Scarf.

1600
01:55:36,595 --> 01:55:38,028
You mean like wool?

1601
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:43,133
No, I meant what women wear with...
You know, decorative.

1602
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:46,333
And where would I get something
like that?

1603
01:55:47,306 --> 01:55:50,605
No disrespect, I just lost in five
for the second year in a row.

1604
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:53,108
Get her a bowling ball for all I care.

1605
01:55:53,312 --> 01:55:54,677
Right.

1606
01:55:55,614 --> 01:55:59,106
Well, Steve told me he's offering you
a new contract.

1607
01:56:00,619 --> 01:56:02,280
Yes.

1608
01:56:02,488 --> 01:56:05,116
So why did you return my call?

1609
01:56:07,259 --> 01:56:09,784
Because it's the Red Sox.

1610
01:56:09,995 --> 01:56:14,489
Because I believe science might offer
an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.

1611
01:56:15,234 --> 01:56:20,467
- Because I hear you hired Bill James.
- Yup.

1612
01:56:20,673 --> 01:56:25,337
You know, why someone took so long
to hire that guy is beyond me.

1613
01:56:26,345 --> 01:56:28,643
Well, baseball hates him.

1614
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:33,912
Well, baseball can hate him,
you know.

1615
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:38,055
One of the great things about money
is that it buys a lot of things...

1616
01:56:38,257 --> 01:56:41,749
...one of which is the luxury
to disregard what baseball likes...

1617
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:44,862
...doesn't like, what baseball thinks,
doesn't think.

1618
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:49,133
Sounds nice.

1619
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:53,929
Well, I was grateful for the call.

1620
01:56:54,139 --> 01:56:55,970
- You were grateful?
- Yeah.

1621
01:56:59,245 --> 01:57:03,113
For 41 million,
you built a play-off team.

1622
01:57:03,315 --> 01:57:07,581
You lost Damon, Giambi,
Isringhausen, Peña...

1623
01:57:08,053 --> 01:57:11,420
...and you won more games
without them than you did with them.

1624
01:57:11,624 --> 01:57:14,991
You won the exact same number
of games that the Yankees won...

1625
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:19,062
...but the Yankees spent 1.4 million
per win...

1626
01:57:19,265 --> 01:57:22,701
...and you paid 260,000.

1627
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:26,929
I know you're taking it in the teeth,
but the first guy through the wall...

1628
01:57:27,406 --> 01:57:29,533
...he always gets bloody.

1629
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:33,109
Always. This is threatening
not just a way of doing business...

1630
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:35,803
...but in their minds,
it's threatening the game.

1631
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:39,280
Really, what it's threatening
is their livelihood, their jobs.

1632
01:57:39,485 --> 01:57:42,454
It's threatening the way
that they do things.

1633
01:57:42,655 --> 01:57:43,986
Every time that happens...

1634
01:57:44,189 --> 01:57:47,647
...whether it's a government,
a way of doing business, whatever...

1635
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:50,351
...the people
who are holding the reins...

1636
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:53,088
...they have their hands
on the switch...

1637
01:57:53,299 --> 01:57:55,767
...they go batshit crazy.

1638
01:57:56,835 --> 01:58:01,636
I mean, anybody who's not
tearing their team down right now...

1639
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,900
...and rebuilding it
using your model...

1640
01:58:05,844 --> 01:58:07,607
...they're dinosaurs.

1641
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:12,650
They'll be sitting on their ass
on the sofa in October...

1642
01:58:12,851 --> 01:58:16,309
...watching the Boston Red Sox
win the World Series.

1643
01:58:21,727 --> 01:58:23,592
What's this?

1644
01:58:23,796 --> 01:58:27,254
I want you to be my general manager.
That's my offer.

1645
01:59:14,246 --> 01:59:15,679
Heads up.

1646
01:59:17,383 --> 01:59:18,372
What was that?

1647
01:59:19,652 --> 01:59:22,678
- Sorry. I don't know.
- What the hell was that?

1648
01:59:23,422 --> 01:59:25,686
You knucklehead.

1649
01:59:33,265 --> 01:59:34,562
How was Boston?

1650
01:59:36,135 --> 01:59:38,000
Impressive.

1651
01:59:44,476 --> 01:59:47,070
Did Henry make you a good offer,
at least?

1652
01:59:48,647 --> 01:59:51,673
- Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
- What was it? What was it?

1653
01:59:51,884 --> 01:59:53,476
- Doesn't matter.
- What was it?

1654
02:00:16,575 --> 02:00:20,033
That makes you the highest-paid GM
in the history of sports.

1655
02:00:22,514 --> 02:00:23,947
So?

1656
02:00:25,784 --> 02:00:26,978
So what?

1657
02:00:30,055 --> 02:00:32,489
I made one decision in my life
based on money.

1658
02:00:32,691 --> 02:00:35,592
And I swore
I would never do it again.

1659
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:40,221
You're not doing it for the money.

1660
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:43,234
- No?
- No.

1661
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:47,761
You're doing it
for what the money says.

1662
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:52,904
And it says what it says to any player
that makes big money.

1663
02:00:53,612 --> 02:00:55,341
That they're worth it.

1664
02:01:03,822 --> 02:01:05,517
What a dump.

1665
02:01:09,728 --> 02:01:12,026
I really wanted to win here.

1666
02:01:16,101 --> 02:01:18,592
I really did.

1667
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,267
I think you won pretty big, Billy.

1668
02:01:24,143 --> 02:01:26,236
Pete, we lost.

1669
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:30,405
We lost.

1670
02:01:30,616 --> 02:01:34,052
It's only been a few days.
Give yourself some time to get over it.

1671
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:38,849
Man, I don't get over these things.
Ever.

1672
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:49,527
Come with me to the video room.
I wanna show you something.

1673
02:01:51,303 --> 02:01:54,568
No, man,
I'm not up for film right now.

1674
02:01:55,841 --> 02:01:57,900
Come on. Seriously.

1675
02:01:58,110 --> 02:02:00,237
Come on, Billy. Come on.

1676
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,072
The Visalia Oaks...

1677
02:02:03,282 --> 02:02:06,046
...and our 240-pound catcher,
Jeremy Brown...

1678
02:02:06,251 --> 02:02:09,812
...who, as you know,
is scared to run to second base.

1679
02:02:10,022 --> 02:02:11,785
This was in a game six weeks ago.

1680
02:02:12,391 --> 02:02:14,484
This guy's gonna start
with a fastball.

1681
02:02:14,693 --> 02:02:17,093
Jeremy's gonna take him
to deep center.

1682
02:02:19,298 --> 02:02:20,765
Here's what's interesting...

1683
02:02:20,966 --> 02:02:23,799
...because Jeremy's gonna do
what he never does.

1684
02:02:24,002 --> 02:02:25,264
He's gonna go for it.

1685
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:28,667
He's gonna round first
and he's gonna go for it.

1686
02:02:29,942 --> 02:02:31,170
Okay?

1687
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:39,450
This is all of Jeremy's nightmares
coming to life.

1688
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:45,317
- They're laughing at him.
- And Jeremy's about to find out why.

1689
02:02:48,527 --> 02:02:50,859
Jeremy's about to realize...

1690
02:02:52,364 --> 02:02:55,458
...that the ball went 60 feet
over the fence.

1691
02:02:58,103 --> 02:03:01,698
He hit a home run
and didn't even realize it.

1692
02:03:31,737 --> 02:03:34,729
How can you not be romantic
about baseball?

1693
02:03:39,711 --> 02:03:42,578
- It's a metaphor.
- I know it's a metaphor.

1694
02:03:47,352 --> 02:03:48,683
Okay.

1695
02:03:52,791 --> 02:03:55,783
Pete, you're a good egg.

1696
02:03:59,264 --> 02:04:00,959
I'll call you.

1697
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:05,354
<i>Hey, Dad, this is the song I told you
I'd record.</i>

1698
02:05:05,564 --> 02:05:08,260
<i>Please don't show it to anyone else.</i>

1699
02:05:08,467 --> 02:05:11,493
<i>Let me know if you change your mind
and stay in California.</i>

1700
02:05:11,703 --> 02:05:14,695
<i>If not, you're a really great dad.</i>
